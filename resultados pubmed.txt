AB  - Transplantation of vascularized composite tissue is a relatively new field that 
      is an amalgamation of experience in solid organ transplantation and 
      reconstructive plastic and orthopedic surgery. What is novel about the 
      immunobiology of VCA is the addition of tissues with unique immunologic 
      characteristics such as skin and vascularized bone, and the nature of VCA grafts, 
      with direct exposure to the environment, and external forces of trauma. VCAs are 
      distinguished from solid organ transplants by the requirement of rigorous 
      physical therapy for optimal outcomes and the fact that these procedures are not 
      lifesaving in most cases. In this review, we will discuss the immunobiology of 
      these systems and how the interplay can result in pathology unique to VCA as well 
      as provide potential targets for therapy.

TI  - Abdominal wall allotransplantation.
PG  - 184-189
LID - 10.5507/bp.2018.038 [doi]
AB  - Allotransplantation of vascularized composite tissue is a new field of 
      transplantation surgery. One application of this technique is abdominal wall 
      transplantation used as a supplementary procedure to the transplantation of 
      visceral organs in patients with abdominal compartment deficits. As abdominal 
      wall closure problems are experienced in around 30-40% of such patients, peer 
      reviewed conclusions on the viability of various options, are important for an 
      informed choice of possible procedures. This review focuses on the abdominal wall 
      allotransplantion procedure. Our search provided 35 appropriate references which 
      we used to support our findings as follows: abdominal wall transplantation was 
      performed in 33 patients at seven centres. Of these, 30 had a full thickness 
      abdominal wall transplanted from the same donor, 3 from a second donor. Three had 
      visceral organ transplants and in addition, the posterior sheet of the rectus 
      muscle fascia. In summary, our findings were that abdominal wall 
      allotransplantation does not jeopardize the outcome of visceral organs 
      transplantation. There is no higher risk of complications or rejection of the 
      visceral organs. There have been no fatalities as a direct result of 
      complications due to abdominal wall transplantation. Finally, the transplanted 
      abdominal wall may provide an early warning of rejection before diagnostic tests 
      on the bowel are symptomatic.

AB  - End-stage organ failure often requires solid organ transplantation. Nevertheless, 
      transplant rejection remains an unresolved issue. The induction of donor-specific 
      tolerance is the ultimate goal in transplantation research. In this study, an 
      allograft vascularized skin rejection model using BALB/c-C57/BL6 mice was 
      established to evaluate the regulation of the poliovirus receptor signaling 
      pathway using CD226 knockout or T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain 
      (TIGIT)-crystallizable fragment (Fc) recombinant protein treatment. In the 
      TIGIT-Fc-treated and CD226 knockout groups, graft survival time prolonged 
      significantly, with a regulatory T cell proportion increase and M2-type 
      macrophage polarization. Donor-reactive recipient T cells became hyporesponsive 
      while responding normally after a third-party antigen challenge. In both groups, 
      serum interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor-α, 
      interferon gamma, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels decreased, and 
      the IL-10 level increased. In vitro, M2 markers, such as Arg1 and IL-10, were 
      markedly increased by TIGIT-Fc, whereas iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p70, tumor 
      necrosis factor-α, and interferon gamma levels decreased. CD226-Fc exerted the 
      opposite effect. TIGIT suppressed T(H)1 and T(H)17 differentiation by inhibiting 
      macrophage SHP-1 phosphorylation and enhanced ERK1/2-MSK1 phosphorylation and 
      nuclear translocation of CREB. In conclusion, CD226 and TIGIT competitively bind 
      to poliovirus receptor with activating and inhibitory functions, respectively. 
      Mechanistically, TIGIT promotes IL-10 transcription from macrophages by 
      activating the ERK1/2-MSK1-CREB pathway and enhancing M2-type polarization. 
      CD226/TIGIT-poliovirus receptor are crucial regulatory molecules of allograft 
      rejection.

AB  - Vascularized composite allotransplants (VCAs) have unique properties because of 
      diverse tissue components transplanted en mass as a single unit. In addition to 
      surgery, this type of transplant also faces enormous immunological challenges 
      that demand a detailed analysis of all aspects of alloimmune responses, organ 
      preservation, and injury, as well as the immunogenicity of various tissues within 
      the VCA grafts to further improve graft and patient outcomes. Moreover, the side 
      effects of long-term immunosuppression for VCA patients need to be carefully 
      balanced with the potential benefit of a non-life-saving procedure. In this 
      review article, we provide a comprehensive update on limb and face 
      transplantation, with a specific emphasis on the alloimmune responses to VCA, 
      established and novel immunosuppressive treatments, and patient outcomes.

PG  - 2728-2745
LID - 10.1111/febs.14474 [doi]
AB  - In the first half of the 20th century, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
      of the laboratory mouse, the H-2 complex, was defined by a combination of 
      serology and genetics. In the second half of the 20th century, its human 
      counterpart, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex was similarly defined and 
      shown to mediate rejection of allogeneic kidney grafts. The clinical relevance of 
      the transplantation antigens created the field of transplant immunology, which 
      aimed to reduce graft rejection by HLA matching of transplant donors and 
      recipients, and to use immunosuppressive drugs to prevent and treat rejection. 
      Because tissue transplantation is not a natural phenomenon, the relevance of the 
      MHC for immunology and immune defense against microbial pathogens was frequently 
      questioned. In the 1970s, the general observation that cytotoxic T-cell responses 
      to viral infection required recognition of both a viral antigen and a 
      transplantation antigen argued for the immunological importance of the MHC. 
      Proving this point was not achieved until close to the end of the 20th century. 
      This required detailed biochemical and structural analysis of the transplantation 
      antigens, the viral antigens, and the T-cell receptors that recognized them. This 
      century of research culminated in 1996 with the three-dimensional 
      crystallographic structure of the complex of these three components. In this 
      complex is MAC, the very first HLA antigen to be detected and now more formally 
      known as HLA-A*02:01.

      humans, skin transplantation in mice has been widely employed for transplantation 
      research. The procedure is easy to learn and perform, and it does not require 
      delicate microsurgical techniques nor extensive training. Moreover, graft 
      rejection in this model occurs in a very reproducible immunological reaction and 
      is easily monitored by direct inspection and palpation. In addition, secondary 
      skin transplantation with donor-matched or third-party skin grafts can be 
      performed on more complex transplant models as an alternative and uncomplicated 
      method to assess donor-specific tolerance. The complications are low and are in 
      general limited to anesthesia overdose or respiratory distress after the 
      procedure. Graft failure, on the other hand, occurs commonly as a result of poor 
      preparation of the graft, incorrect positioning in the graft bed, or 
      inappropriate placement of the bandage. In this article, we present a protocol 
      for full-thickness skin transplantation in mice and describe the important steps 
      necessary for a successful procedure.

AB  - Solid organ transplantation can treat end-stage organ failure, but the half-life 
      of transplanted organs colonized with commensals is much shorter than that of 
      sterile organs. Whether organ colonization plays a role in this shorter half-life 
      is not known. We have previously shown that an intact whole-body microbiota can 
      accelerate the kinetics of solid organ allograft rejection in untreated colonized 
      mice when compared to germ-free (GF) or to antibiotic-pre-treated colonized mice, 
      by enhancing the capacity of antigen presenting cells (APCs) to activate 
      graft-reactive T cells. However, the contribution of intestinal versus skin 
      microbiota to these effects was unknown. Here, we demonstrate that colonizing the 
      skin of GF mice with a single commensal, Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi), 
      while preventing intestinal colonization with oral vancomycin, was sufficient to 
      accelerate skin graft rejection. Notably, unlike the mechanism by which 
      whole-body microbiota accelerates skin graft rejection, cutaneous S. epi did not 
      enhance the priming of alloreactive T cells in the skin-draining lymph nodes 
      (LNs). Rather, cutaneous S. epi augmented the ability of skin APCs to drive the 
      differentiation of alloreactive T cells. This study reveals that the 
      extra-intestinal donor microbiota can affect transplant outcome and may 
      contribute to the shorter half-life of colonized organs.

PG  - 801595
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2021.801595 [doi]
LID - 801595
AB  - The importance and exact role of graft-resident leucocytes (also referred to as 
      passenger leucocytes) in transplantation is controversial as these cells have 
      been reported to either initiate or retard graft rejection. T cell activation to 
      allografts is mediated via recognition of intact or processed donor MHC molecules 
      on antigen-presenting cells (APC) as well as through interaction with 
      donor-derived extracellular vesicles. Reduction of graft-resident leucocytes 
      before transplantation is a well-known approach for prolonging organ survival 
      without interfering with the recipient's immune system. As previously shown by 
      our group, injecting mice with IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes (IL-2cplx) to augment 
      expansion of CD4 T regulatory cells (Tregs) induces tolerance towards islet 
      allografts, and also to skin allografts when IL-2cplx treatment is supplemented 
      with rapamycin and a short-term treatment of anti-IL-6. In this study, we 
      investigated the mechanisms by which graft-resident leucocytes impact graft 
      survival by studying the combined effects of IL-2cplx-mediated Treg expansion and 
      passenger leucocyte depletion. For the latter, effective depletion of APC and T 
      cells within the graft was induced by prior total body irradiation (TBI) of the 
      graft donor. Surprisingly, substantial depletion of donor-derived leucocytes by 
      TBI did not prolong graft survival in naïve mice, although it did result in 
      augmented recipient leucocyte graft infiltration, presumably through 
      irradiation-induced nonspecific inflammation. Notably, treatment with the 
      IL-2cplx protocol prevented early inflammation of irradiated grafts, which 
      correlated with an influx of Tregs into the grafts. This finding suggested there 
      might be a synergistic effect of Treg expansion and graft-resident leucocyte 
      depletion. In support of this idea, significant prolongation of skin graft 
      survival was achieved if we combined graft-resident leucocyte depletion with the 
      IL-2cplx protocol; this finding correlated along with a progressive shift in the 
      composition of T cells subsets in the grafts towards a more tolerogenic 
      environment. Donor-specific humoral responses remained unchanged, indicating 
      minor importance of graft-resident leucocytes in anti-donor antibody development. 
      These results demonstrate the importance of donor-derived leucocytes as well as 
      Tregs in allograft survival, which might give rise to new clinical approaches.

AB  - Half a million patients in the USA alone require treatment for burns annually. 
      Following an extensive burn, it may not be possible to provide sufficient 
      autografts in a single setting. Pig skin xenografts may provide temporary 
      coverage. However, preformed xenoreactive antibodies in the human recipient 
      activate complement, and thus result in rapid rejection of the graft. Because 
      burn patients usually have some degree of immune dysfunction and are therefore at 
      increased risk of infection, immunosuppressive therapy is undesirable. Genetic 
      engineering of the pig has increased the survival of pig heart, kidney, islet, 
      and corneal grafts in immunosuppressed non-human primates from minutes to months 
      or occasionally years. We summarize the current status of research into skin 
      xenotransplantation for burns, with special emphasis on developments in genetic 
      engineering of pigs to protect the graft from immunological injury. A 
      genetically-engineered pig skin graft now survives as long as an allograft and, 
      importantly, rejection of a skin xenograft is not detrimental to a subsequent 
      allograft. Nevertheless, currently, systemic immunosuppressive therapy would 
      still be required to inhibit a cellular response, and so we discuss what further 
      genetic manipulations could be carried out to inhibit the cellular response.

AB  - Vascularized composite allografts (VCAs) are a growing field within the area of 
      transplantation. In 2014, the birth of a healthy baby after a successful uterus 
      transplant from a living donor was reported in Sweden. VCAs are not specifically 
      mentioned in any of the transplant acts of the Eurotransplant (ET) member states, 
      which all belong to the European Union (EU). The Competent Authorities (CA) of 
      the EU decided in 2012 that VCAs are to be regarded as organs. At the moment, 
      there are no general guidelines in the ET area concerning wait list registration, 
      allocation, procurement and transplantation, and also no regulations concerning 
      reimbursement. To further develop this aspect, common policies and guidelines 
      within the ET member states have to be developed.

      transplant outcome remains uncertain. Using a model of voluntary wheel-running 
      exercise and skin transplantation in mice, we hypothesized that exercise 
      strengthens the alloimmune response, leading to an increased rate of rejection. 
      Instead, we found that regular exercise in mice resulted in prolonged graft 
      survival, with mean allograft survival time increasing by almost 50%. We observed 
      this graft survival extension in exercised mice despite evidence of a slightly 
      enhanced alloimmune response, comprised of increased proliferation of 
      alloreactive CD4(+) T cells, as well as increased interferon-γ production by 
      these cells. Exercise was not associated with significant changes in numbers of 
      conventional CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells, NK cells, or Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. 
      In conclusion, our study suggests that exercise increases skin graft resistance 
      to a similar or slightly higher level of alloimmunity and supports regular 
      exercise as an important beneficial pursuit for transplant recipients.

PG  - 540-549
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000003442 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Organ transplantation is life-saving and continued investigations 
      into immunologic mechanisms that drive organ rejection are needed to improve 
      immunosuppression therapies and prevent graft failure. DNA-dependent protein 
      kinase catalytic subunit, DNA dependent-protein kinase catalytic subunit 
      (DNA-PKcs), is a critical component of both the cellular and humoral immune 
      responses. In this study, we investigate the contribution of DNA-PKcs to 
      allogeneic skin graft rejection to potentially highlight a novel strategy for 
      inhibiting transplant rejection. METHODS: Fully MHC mismatched murine allogeneic 
      skin graft studies were performed by transplanting skin from BalbC mice to C57bl6 
      mice and treating with either vehicle or the DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7441. Graft 
      rejection, cytokine production, immune cell infiltration, and donor-specific 
      antibody formation were analyzed. RESULTS: DNA-PKcs inhibition significantly 
      reduced necrosis and extended graft survival compared with controls (mean 
      survival 14 d versus 9 d, respectively). Inhibition reduced the production of the 
      cytokines interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ and the 
      infiltration of CD3+ lymphocytes into grafts. Furthermore, DNA-PKcs inhibition 
      reduced the number of CD19+ B cells and CD19+ CD138+ plasma cells coinciding with 
      a significant reduction in donor-specific antibodies. At a molecular level, we 
      determined that the immunosuppressive effects of DNA-PKcs inhibition were 
      mediated, in part, via inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of 
      activated B cells signaling through reduced expression of the p65 subunit. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that DNA-PKcs contributes to allogeneic graft 
      rejection and highlight a novel immunologic function for DNA-PKcs in the 
      regulation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and 
      concomitant cytokine production.

TI  - Delayed allogeneic skin graft rejection in CD26-deficient mice.
PG  - 557-567
LID - 10.1038/s41423-018-0009-z [doi]
AB  - Organ transplantation is an effective therapeutic tool for treating many terminal 
      diseases. However, one of the biggest challenges of transplantation is 
      determining how to achieve the long-term survival of the allogeneic or xenogeneic 
      transplant by, for example, preventing transplant rejection. In the current 
      study, CD26 gene-knockout mice were used to investigate the potential role of 
      CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPPIV) in allogeneic skin graft rejection by 
      tail-skin transplantation. Compared with wild-type (CD26(+/+)) counterparts, 
      CD26(-/-) mice showed reduced necrosis of grafts and delayed graft rejection 
      after skin transplantation. Concentrations of serum IgG, including its subclasses 
      IgG1 and IgG2a, were significantly reduced in CD26(-/-) mice during graft 
      rejection. Moreover, after allogeneic skin transplantation, the secretion levels 
      of the cytokines IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-13 were significantly reduced, 
      whereas the level of the cytokine IL-10 was increased in the serum of CD26(-/-) 
      mice compared with that in the serum of CD26(+/+) mice. Additionally, the 
      concentration of IL-17 in serum and the percentage of cells secreting IL-17 in 
      mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes (MPBLs) were both significantly lower, while 
      the percentage of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was significantly higher in MPBLs of 
      CD26(-/-) mice than in those of CD26(+/+) mice. Furthermore, a lower percentage 
      of CD8(+) T cells in MPBLs and fewer infiltrated macrophages and T cells in graft 
      tissues of CD26(-/-) mice were detected during graft rejection. These results 
      indicate that CD26 is involved in allogeneic skin graft rejection and provides 
      another hint that CD26 deficiency leads to less rejection due to lower activation 
      and proliferation of host immune cells.

TI  - Disinfection of human skin allografts in tissue banking: a systematic review 
      report.
PG  - 585-592
AB  - The use of skin allografts to temporarily replace lost or damaged skin is 
      practiced worldwide. Naturally occurring contamination can be present on skin or 
      can be introduced at recovery or during processing. This contamination can pose a 
      threat to allograft recipients. Bacterial culture and disinfection of allografts 
      are mandated, but the specific practices and methodologies are not dictated by 
      standards. A systematic review of literature from three databases found 12 
      research articles that evaluated bioburden reduction processes of skin grafts. 
      The use of broad spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents was the most 
      frequently identified disinfection method reported demonstrating reductions in 
      contamination rates. It was determined that the greatest reduction in the skin 
      allograft contamination rates utilized 0.1 % peracetic acid or 25 kGy of gamma 
      irradiation at lower temperatures.

TI  - Treating Wounds With an Avascular Component With a Dermal Regenerative Template.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Partially avascular wounds pose a challenge to wound care surgeons. 
      OBJECTIVE: The authors reviewed the literature and institutional results on the 
      use of a dermal regenerative template (DRT) over partially avascular wounds to 
      quantify the ability of the DRT to vascularize over these wounds. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A review of the literature was performed using Ovid MEDLINE, Google 
      Scholar, and Cochrane Library. Patient demographics, comorbidities, wound types, 
      surface area of avascular tissues, and skin graft take were analyzed. A 
      retrospective review of institutional cases was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 32 
      articles met inclusion criteria. The retrospective review included 26 patients 
      with partially avascular wounds reconstructed with the DRT. Seventeen patients 
      experienced 100% graft take, 6 experienced partial take, and 3 suffered complete 
      loss. The percent and absolute size of avascular surface area in the wound was 
      significantly lower in cases of complete graft take compared with partial take 
      and complete loss (1.9% and 2.7 cm2; 9.3% and 10.0 cm2; 18.0% and 9.3 cm2, 
      respectively, P ⟨ .001). Chronic wound status (P ⟨ .001) was significantly 
      associated with less graft take. CONCLUSIONS: This literature review and 
      retrospective study confirm the DRT is a viable option to provide vascularized 
      coverage over wounds with avascular components. This study suggests the DRT is 
      more reliable in wounds with less than 1.9% avascular tissues and less successful 
      in chronic wounds.

AB  - The longevity of grafts remains a major challenge in allogeneic transplantation 
      due to immune rejection. Systemic immunosuppression can impair graft function and 
      can also cause severe adverse effects. Here, we report a local immuno-protective 
      strategy to enhance post-transplant persistence of allografts using a mesenchymal 
      stem cell membrane-derived vesicle (MMV)-crosslinked hydrogel (MMV-Gel). MMVs are 
      engineered to upregulate expression of Fas ligand (FasL) and programmed death 
      ligand 1 (PD-L1). The MMVs are retained within the hydrogel by crosslinking. The 
      immuno-protective microenvironment of the hydrogel protects allografts by 
      presenting FasL and PD-L1. The binding of these ligands to T effector cells, the 
      dominant contributors to graft destruction and rejection, results in apoptosis of 
      T effector cells and generation of regulatory T cells. We demonstrate that 
      implantation with MMV-Gel prolongs the survival and function of grafts in mouse 
      models of allogeneic pancreatic islet cells and skin transplantation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcomes of negative-pressure wound therapy 
      (NPWT) versus conventional therapy on split-thickness skin after grafting 
      surgery. DESIGN: Meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Split-thickness skin grafts are 
      widely used in reconstruction of large skin defects. Conventional therapy causes 
      pain during dressing changing. NPWT is an alternative method to cover the wound 
      bed. METHODS: The Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or cohort studies for articles published 
      between 1993 and April 2017 comparing NPWT to conventional wound therapy for 
      split-thickness skin grafts. The rate of graft take was the primary outcome of 
      this meta-analysis. Wound infection and reoperation rate of the wound were 
      secondary outcomes. Data analysis was conducted using the Review Manager 5.3 
      software. RESULTS: Five cohort studies and seven RCTs including 653 patients were 
      eligible for inclusion. Patients treated with NPWT had a significantly higher 
      rate of graft take compared to those treated with conventional therapy 
      [MD = 7.02, (95% CI 3.74, 10.31)] (P = .00). NPWT was associated with a reduction 
      in reoperation [RR = 0.28, (95% CI 0.14, 0.55)] (P = .00). The reduction in wound 
      infection was not significant [RR = 0.63, (95% CI 0.31, 1.27)] (P = .20). 
      CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional therapy, NPWT significantly increases the 
      rate of graft take and reduces the rate of reoperation when applied to cover the 
      wound bed with split-thickness skin graft. No significant impact on wound 
      infection was found in this study.

TI  - Utilization of Perifascial Loose Areolar Tissue Grafting as an Autologous Dermal 
      Substitute in Extremity Burns.
PG  - 2192786
LID - 10.1080/08941939.2023.2192786 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perifascial areolar tissue (PAT) is an areolar layer over the muscle 
      fascia. PAT has been shown to be resistant to ischemia and prone to survival even 
      in ischemic conditions. PAT grafts provide a vascular tissue layer on necrotic 
      bone and tendons where skin grafting is not possible. The effect of PAT grafting 
      on burn reconstruction has not yet been reported. Thus, in this study, we aimed 
      to present our experience and discuss the role of PAT grafting in extremity burn 
      reconstruction. METHODS: Between January 2019 and December 2020, 16 PAT grafting 
      procedures were performed in 11 patients. All patients had second- or 
      third-degree burns in the upper and lower extremities, with exposed bone or 
      tendon. PAT grafts were harvested from the abdominal region and were used for the 
      upper extremity in 7 patients and the lower extremity in 4 patients. Immediate 
      skin grafting was performed during the same session. RESULTS: The patients' mean 
      age was 50.7 years; defect size, 3.3 × 3 cm(2); and follow-up time, 11.8 months. 
      The survival rates of the PAT and skin grafts were 93.8% and 68.6%, respectively. 
      Partial skin graft losses were encountered in 4 patients, and total skin graft 
      loss was seen in 1 patient. CONCLUSION: PAT grafting is an alternative method to 
      the use of dermal substitutes and flap surgery in small-to-medium-sized defects 
      with exposed bone and tendon in burn patients.

AB  - Intestinal commensals can exert immunomodulatory effects on the host, with 
      beneficial or detrimental consequences depending on underlying diseases. We have 
      previously correlated longer survival of minor mismatched skin grafts in mice 
      with the presence of an intestinal commensal bacterium, Alistipes onderdonkii. In 
      this study, we investigated its sufficiency and mechanism of action. Oral 
      administration of A onderdonkii strain DSM19147 but not DSM108265 was sufficient 
      to prolong minor mismatched skin graft survival through inhibition of tumor 
      necrosis factor production. Through metabolomic and metagenomic comparisons 
      between DSM19147 and DSM108265, we identified candidate gene products associated 
      with the anti-inflammatory effect of DSM19147. A onderdonkii DSM19147 can lower 
      inflammation both at a steady state and after transplantation and may serve as an 
      anti-inflammatory probiotic beneficial for transplant recipients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Urethral reconstruction in complex hypospadias poses a significant 
      challenge. We report our 10-year experience with buccal mucosa graft (BMG) in the 
      two-stage repair of complex hypospadias and compare its results to the skin 
      graft. METHODS: We retrieved the data of 15 patients with complex hypospadias who 
      underwent two-stage repair using the BMG at our institution. The data were 
      compared to 13 patients who underwent skin graft during the same period. RESULTS: 
      The median follow-up duration was 14 (12-17) months in the BMG group and 16 
      (13.5-22.5) months in the skin graft group. Patients in the BMG had a numerically 
      lower incidence of the diverticulum, wound dehiscence, fistula, and infection 
      than the skin graft group, however, without statistically significant difference 
      (p > 0.05). On the other hand, the incidence of meatal stenosis and urethral 
      stricture was significantly lower in the BMG group (0% each) compared to the skin 
      graft group (30.8% each; p = 0.02). At the same time, there were no reported 
      cases of graft contracture. The frequency of donor site morbidity was 
      significantly higher in the skin graft group compared to the BMG group 
      (p = 0.003). The BMG led to a lower incidence of postoperative straining than the 
      skin graft (0% vs. 38.5%, p = 0.03). Only one patient needed revision surgery 
      after skin graft, compared to no case in the BMG (p = 0.27). CONCLUSION: The 
      present study demonstrates the feasibility and durable outcomes of the BMG in the 
      setting of two-stage repair of complex hypospadias.

TI  - Primed macrophages directly and specifically reject allografts.
PG  - 237-246
LID - 10.1038/s41423-019-0226-0 [doi]
AB  - Monocytes and macrophages have long been associated with acute and chronic 
      allograft rejection; this is mediated by their abilities to promote inflammation, 
      kill target cells via antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and modulate adaptive 
      immunity. Our present study showed that allogeneic antigen-primed macrophages 
      acutely rejected skin grafts with specificity after adoptive transfer into 
      MHC-matched immunodeficient mice. The ability of primed macrophages to reject 
      allografts essentially requires the help of CD4(+) T cells and does not require 
      the help of CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, the primed, perforin-deficient macrophages 
      rejected the skin grafts in a significantly delayed pattern compared with WT 
      macrophages, indicating that the perforin pathway of the primed macrophages is 
      likely involved in the rejection process. Thus, primed macrophages are endowed 
      with adaptive immunity-like features, such as specificity, with the help of 
      CD4(+) T cells during the immune response to allografts. The present study 
      challenges our traditional views of macrophage functions and highlights the 
      biological functions of macrophages beyond innate immunity in mammals.

TI  - Association of Skin and Cartilage Variables With Composite Graft Healing in a 
      Rabbit Model.
PG  - 44-49
LID - 10.1001/jamafacial.2018.1044 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Composite grafting in nasal reconstruction involves transplanting 
      auricular chondrocutaneous grafts, but the optimal design of these grafts is 
      unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the ideal ratio of skin to cartilage as well 
      as study the importance of the perichondrial attachment for graft survival. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A New England white rabbit model was used in 
      this study, performed at the Laboratory for Animal Research at University of 
      Kansas Medical Center from January 25 to March 18, 2016. Four varying designs of 
      chondrocutaneous auricular grafts were transplanted to dorsal back defects, with 
      a total of 10 grafts per treatment arm completed. The following 4 
      chondrocutaneous circular grafts were designed: group A, 1.5-cm diameter graft of 
      equal skin to cartilage ratio; group B, 2.0-cm diameter skin and 1.5-cm diameter 
      cartilage; group C, 1.5-cm diameter skin and 2.0-cm diameter cartilage; and group 
      D, 1.5-cm diameter skin and cartilage separated and placed back together in a 
      layered fashion. Grafts were observed until postoperative day 21, harvested, and 
      evaluated with visual observation as well as histopathologic assessment. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Visually graded areas of survival were marked by 2 blinded 
      academic facial plastic surgeons and calculated for approximate survival. 
      Hematoxylin-eosin-stained, paraffin-embedded 5-μm slides were evaluated for 
      overall survival rate, rate of cartilage necrosis, and mean vessel density per 
      high-power field. In both cases, observers were blinded as to the study group. 
      RESULTS: Visual assessments of the 5 female rabbits showed significant agreement 
      between surgeons and consistency, with a Spearman coefficient of 0.84 and an 
      intraclass correlation of 0.98. Group D (skin and cartilage separation) was 
      visually graded to have significantly decreased mean survival (45.4%; 95% CI, 
      23.3%-67.4%) compared with group A (mean survival, 97.4%; 95% CI, 94.8%-99.9%; 
      P < .001), group B (mean survival, 87.6%; 95% CI, 69.9%-100%; P = .004), and 
      group C (mean survival, 82.1%; 95% CI, 66.0%-98.1%; P = .008). Histopathologic 
      assessment revealed that group D again showed significantly inferior overall 
      survival, increased cartilage necrosis, and decreased mean vessel density 
      compared with group A. Group C additionally showed significantly decreased 
      cartilage survival compared with group A (65% vs 0%; P < .001) and group B (65% 
      vs 35%; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results represent preliminary 
      evidence that the attachment of skin to perichondrium in a composite graft plays 
      an important role for graft survival. Clinicians performing nasal reconstruction 
      with chondrocutaneous composite grafts should consider preserving attachments at 
      this junction to improve graft survival. LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: NA.

AB  - Renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) are the primary targets of 
      ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and rejection by the recipient's immune 
      response in kidney transplantation (KTx). However, the molecular mechanism of 
      rejection and IRI remains to be identified. Our previous study demonstrated that 
      kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) and kynureninase were reduced in 
      ischemia-reperfusion procedure and further decreased in rejection allografts 
      among mismatched pig KTx. Herein, we reveal that TEC injury in acutely rejection 
      allografts is associated with alterations of Bcl2 family proteins, reduction of 
      tight junction protein 1 (TJP1), and TEC-specific KMO. Three cytokines, IFN γ , 
      TNFα, and IL1β, reported in our previous investigation were identified as 
      triggers of TEC injury by altering the expression of Bcl2, BID, and TJP1. 
      Allograft rejection and TEC injury were always associated with a dramatic 
      reduction of KMO. 3HK and 3HAA, as direct and downstream products of KMO, 
      effectively protected TEC from injury via increasing expression of Bcl-xL and 
      TJP1. Both 3HK and 3HAA further prevented allograft rejection by inhibiting T 
      cell proliferation and up-regulating aryl hydrocarbon receptor expression. Pig 
      KTx with the administration of DNA nanoparticles (DNP) that induce expression of 
      indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and KMO to increase 3HK/3HAA showed an 
      improvement of allograft rejection as well as murine skin transplant in IDO 
      knockout mice with the injection of 3HK indicated a dramatic reduction of 
      allograft rejection. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that 
      reduction of KMO in the graft is a key mediator of allograft rejection and loss. 
      KMO can effectively improve allograft outcome by attenuating allograft rejection 
      and maintaining graft barrier function.

AB  - Dendritic cells (DC) initiate the immune response in the body. They can stimulate 
      T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation and ultimately participate 
      in the immune response and the immune tolerance response. The purpose of this 
      study was to coculture DCs and T cells and subcutaneously inject DCs transfected 
      with miR-let-7i into rhesus monkey transplantations to verify the role of 
      miR-let-7i in allograft immune tolerance. In vitro studies found that the 
      expression of miR-let-7i was upregulated after inducing the maturation of DCs. 
      The low expression of miR-let-7i inhibited the maturation of DCs, promoted the 
      differentiation of T cells into T helper T cells 2 (Th2), and inhibited T helper 
      T cell 1- (Th1-) driven rejection. In vivo studies also obtained similar results, 
      and subcutaneous injection of DCs transfected with miR-let-7i inhibitor prolonged 
      the survival time of allogeneic skin transplantation. Therefore, we conclude that 
      inhibition of miR-let-7i inhibits DC maturation and improves the tolerance of 
      grafted skin.

AB  - More and more aged people are undergoing organ transplantation. Understanding 
      aging effects on immunity will be helpful for post-transplantation care and 
      adjustment of immunosuppressants for aged recipients. A mouse model, using C3H 
      mice as donors and aged/young C57BL/10J mice as recipients, was employed to study 
      aging effects on immunity. The results showed that frequency of myeloid-derived 
      suppressor cells (MDSC) and level of TGF-β was higher in aged mice than in young 
      mice (4.4 ± 1.4% versus 1.6 ± 1.1%, p = 0.026 for MDSC; 21.04 ± 3.91 ng/ml versus 
      15.26 ± 5.01 ng/ml, p = 0.026 for TGF-β). In vivo, skin allograft survived longer 
      on the aged than on young mice (19.7 ± 5.2 days versus 11.9 ± 4.1 days, p = 
      0.005). When entinostat was applied to block MDSC, the survival of skin 
      allografts on aged mice was shorten to 13.5 ± 4.7 days which was not different 
      from the survival on young mice (p = 0.359). In conclusion, allogeneic immunity 
      was different in aged from young mice in high frequency of MDSC and high serum 
      level of TGF-β. Blocking the function of MDSC reversed the low immunity in aged 
      mice and caused skin allograft rejection similar to young recipients.

AB  - Fibroblasts, or their homolog stromal cells, are present in most tissues and play 
      an essential role in tissue homeostasis and regeneration. As a result, 
      fibroblast-based strategies have been widely employed in tissue engineering. 
      However, while considered to have immunosuppressive properties, the survival and 
      functionality of allogeneic fibroblasts after transplantation remain 
      controversial. Here, we evaluated innate and adaptive immune responses against 
      allogeneic fibroblasts following intradermal injection into different 
      immune-deficient mouse strains. While allogeneic fibroblasts were rejected 1 week 
      after transplantation in immunocompetent mice, rejection did not occur in 
      immunodeficient γ chain-deficient NOD-SCID (NSG) mice. T-cell- and 
      B-cell-deficient RAG1 knockout mice showed greater loss of fibroblasts by day 5 
      after transplantation compared with NSG mice (P ≤ 0.05) but prolonged persistence 
      compared with wild-type recipient (P ≤ 0.005). Loss of fibroblasts correlated 
      with the expression of proinflammatory chemokine genes and infiltration of 
      myeloid cells in the transplantation site. Depletion of macrophages and 
      neutrophils delayed rejection, revealing the role of innate immune cells in an 
      early elimination of fibroblasts that is followed by T-cell-mediated rejection in 
      the second week. These findings indicate that the application of allogeneic 
      fibroblasts in tissue engineering products requires further improvements to 
      overcome cell rejection by innate and adaptive immune cells.

TI  - Antibodies against complement component C5 prevent antibody-mediated rejection 
      after lung transplantation in murine orthotopic models with skin-graft-induced 
      pre-sensitization.
PG  - 1032-1041
LID - 10.1007/s11748-022-01844-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) could induce acute or chronic graft 
      failure during organ transplantation. Several reports have shown that anti-C5 
      antibodies are effective against AMR after kidney transplantation. However, few 
      reports have assessed the efficacy of anti-C5 antibodies against AMR after lung 
      transplantation. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of this 
      novel therapy against AMR after lung transplantation. METHODS: BALB/c and C57BL/6 
      mice were used as donors and recipients. One group was pre-sensitized (PS) by 
      skin transplantation 14 days before lung transplantation. The other group was 
      non-sensitized (NS). Orthotopic left-lung transplantation was performed in both 
      groups. Animals were killed at 2 or 7 days after lung transplantation and 
      evaluated for histopathology, C4d immunostaining, and serum donor-specific 
      antibodies (DSAs) (n = 5 per group). Isograft (IS) models with C57BL/6 mice were 
      used as controls. To evaluate the efficacy of C5 inhibition, other animals, which 
      received similar treatments to those in the PS group, were treated with anti-C5 
      antibodies, cyclosporine/methylprednisolone, anti-C5 
      antibodies/cyclosporine/methylprednisolone, or isotype-matched irrelevant control 
      monoclonal antibodies (n = 5 per group). RESULTS: Two days after lung 
      transplantation, the NS group exhibited mild, localized graft-rejection features 
      (rejection score: 0.45 ± 0.08, p = 0.107). The PS group exhibited AMR features 
      with a significantly higher rejection score (2.29 ± 0.42, p = 0.001), C4d 
      vascular-endothelium deposition, and substantial presence of serum DSA. On day 7 
      after lung transplantation, both groups showed extensive graft alveolar wall 
      destruction, and high acute-rejection scores. Mice receiving anti-C5 antibodies 
      or anti-C5/antibodies/cyclosporine/methylprednisolone demonstrated significantly 
      lower acute-rejection scores (0.63 ± 0.23, p = 0.002; 0.59 ± 0.22, p = 0.001, 
      respectively) than those receiving isotype control antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Murine orthotopic allograft lung transplant models met the clinical diagnosis and 
      pathogenesis classification criteria of AMR. In these models, anti-C5 antibodies 
      suppressed AMR. Therefore, anti-C5 therapy may be effective against AMR after 
      lung transplantation.

AB  - Periodontal disease can induce dysbiosis, a compositional and functional 
      alteration in the microbiota. Dysbiosis induced by periodontal disease is known 
      to cause systemic inflammation and may affect transplant immunity. Here, we 
      examined the effects of periodontal disease-related intestinal dysbiosis on 
      transplant immunity using a mouse model of allogenic skin graft in which the mice 
      were orally administered the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg). 
      For 6 weeks, the Pg group orally received Pg while the control group orally 
      received phosphate-buffered saline solution. After that, both groups received 
      allogenic skin grafts. 16 s rRNA analysis of feces revealed that oral 
      administration of Pg significantly increased three short chain fatty acids 
      (SCFAs) producing genera. SCFA (acetate and propionate) levels were significantly 
      higher in the Pg group (p = 0.040 and p = 0.005). The ratio of regulatory T 
      cells, which are positively correlated with SCFAs, to total CD4+ T cells in the 
      peripheral blood and spleen was significantly greater (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001) 
      in the Pg group by flowcytometry. Finally, oral administration of Pg 
      significantly prolonged skin graft survival (p < 0.001) and reduced pathological 
      inflammation in transplanted skin grafts. In conclusion, periodontal 
      pathogen-induced intestinal dysbiosis may affect transplant immunity through 
      increased levels of SCFAs and regulatory T cells. (198 words).

TI  - Full thickness skin graft versus split thickness skin graft in paediatric 
      patients with hand burns: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - Our objective was to compare the outcomes of full thickness skin grafts versus 
      split thickness skin grafts in paediatric hand burn patients. A systematic review 
      and meta-analysis were carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines, and an 
      electronic search was conducted to identify all Randomised Controlled Trials and 
      non-randomised studies comparing the outcomes of full thickness skin grafts 
      versus split thickness skin grafts in paediatric hand burn patients. Primary 
      outcomes included development of post-graft contracture and the necessity for 
      surgical release. Secondary outcomes consisted of evaluation of function, 
      cosmesis and colour, scar and feeling, hair growth, and other complaints. For the 
      analysis, fixed effects modelling was applied. Results: ten non-randomised trials 
      with a total of 532 grafts were found. Full thickness skin grafts exhibited a 
      statistically significant decrease in the development of post-graft contracture 
      (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.35, P = 0.0001) and later surgical releases (OR = 0.06, 
      P = 0.00001). For secondary outcomes, full thickness skin grafts outperformed 
      split thickness skin grafts in post-operative functional ability. However, split 
      thickness skin grafts, showed to be superior in scar, aesthetic, and colour 
      assessments, and less hair growth was observed for split thickness skin grafts. 
      No significant difference was seen in sensation and donor or recipient site 
      complaints. Overall, full thickness skin grafts are a better alternative for 
      paediatric hand burns than split thickness skin transplants because they are 
      linked with reduced post-graft contracture and the requirement for surgical 
      release.

TI  - CD147 blockade as a potential and novel treatment of graft rejection.
PG  - 4593-4602
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2017.7201 [doi]
AB  - Cluster of differentiation (CD)147 is highly involved in the T cell activation 
      process. High CD147 expression is observed on the surfaces of activated T cells, 
      particularly CD4+ T cells. In organ transplantation, it is important to prevent 
      graft rejection resulting from the excessive activation of T cells, particularly 
      CD4+ T cells, which exhibit a key role in amplifying the immune response. The 
      present study aimed to investigate the effects of CD147 blockade in vitro and 
      in vivo and used a transplant rejection system to assess the feasibility of 
      utilizing CD147 antibody‑based immunosuppressant drugs for the treatment of graft 
      rejection. The effects of CD147 antibodies were evaluated on lymphocyte 
      proliferation stimulated by phytohemagglutinin or CD3/CD28 magnetic beads and in 
      a one‑way mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) system in vitro. For the in vivo 
      analysis, an allogeneic skin transplantation mouse model was used. CD147 
      antibodies were effective against lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T lymphocytes, 
      and were additionally effective in the one‑way MLR system. In the allogeneic skin 
      transplantation mouse model, the survival of transplanted skin was extended in 
      the CD147 antibody‑treated group. Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cell 
      infiltration in transplanted skin was reduced. CD147 blockade decreased the serum 
      levels of interleukin (IL)‑17 and the proportions of peripheral blood CD4+ and 
      CD8+ memory T cells. The data demonstrated that CD147 blockade suppressed skin 
      graft rejection, primarily by suppressing CD4+T and memory T cell proliferation, 
      indicating that CD147 exhibits great potential as a target of immunosuppressant 
      drugs.

TI  - Surgical Treatment of Pyoderma Gangrenosum with Negative Pressure Wound Therapy 
      and Skin Grafting, Including Xenografts: Personal Experience and Comprehensive 
      Review on 161 Cases.
PG  - 405-425
LID - 10.1089/wound.2020.1160 [doi]
AB  - Significance: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare debilitating autoinflammatory 
      ulcerative skin disease. No gold standard has been established for the treatment 
      of PG. The role of surgical interventions and negative pressure wound therapy 
      (NPWT) was discussed controversially until recently as these procedures might 
      pose a trigger to further aggravate the condition. Recent Advances: Recent 
      advances confirm the paradigm change that a surgical approach of PG with split 
      thickness skin grafting (STSG) secured by NPWT is a safe and valuable treatment 
      if performed under adequate immunosuppression. We elaborate this on the hand of a 
      broad literature search retrieving 101 relevant articles describing 138 patients 
      complemented with our personal experience on 23 patients, including 2 patients 
      treated with a porcine xenodressing. Critical Issues: A wide range of surgical 
      approaches have been reported, including xenografts. Treatment was finally 
      successful in 86%, including the xenotransplant cases. Ten percent improved and 
      failures were mainly reported without immunosuppression. Despite halting the 
      inflammatory process, NPWT alone, without skin grafting, does not much accelerate 
      healing time. The best surgical approach appears to be STSG fixed with NPWT as 
      this leads to higher skin graft take. There remains the problem of the chronic 
      nature of PG and the recurrence after tapering of immunosuppression or trauma; 
      therefore, a sustained immunosuppressive treatment is suggested. Future 
      Directions: While surgical treatment is supported by the published data, the 
      exact immunosuppression is still evolving. Due to deeper insights into 
      pathogenesis and growing clinical reports, a broader utilization of biologic 
      treatments and a shift from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha to interleukin 
      (IL)-12/23 or IL-23 antibodies alone are predictable, as IL-12/23 antibodies show 
      good clinical responses with fewer side effects. The positive results with 
      porcine xenodressings might be due to immunological effects of the xenomaterial; 
      they appear promising, but are preliminary and should be confirmed in a larger 
      patient collective.

      Recruitment.

LID - 2690
AB  - Recent evidences indicate an important role of tissue inflammatory responses by 
      innate immune cells in allograft acceptance and survival. Here we investigated 
      the role of mast cells (MC) in an acute male to female skin allograft rejection 
      model using red MC and basophil (RMB) mice enabling conditional MC depletion. 
      Kinetic analysis showed that MCs markedly accelerate skin rejection. They induced 
      an early inflammatory response through degranulation and boosted local synthesis 
      of KC, MIP-2, and TNF. This enhanced early neutrophil infiltration compared to a 
      female-female graft-associated repair response. The uncontrolled neutrophil 
      influx accelerated rejection as antibody-mediated depletion of neutrophils 
      delayed skin rejection. Administration of cromolyn, a MC stabilizer and to a 
      lesser extent ketotifen, a histamine type I receptor antagonist, and absence of 
      MCPT4 chymase also delayed graft rejection. Together our data indicate that 
      mediators contained in secretory granules of MC promote an inflammatory response 
      with enhanced neutrophil infiltration that accelerate graft rejection.

AB  - Manipulation of human T cell functioning by delivery of macromolecules such as 
      DNA, RNA, or protein is limited, unless the human T cells have been stimulated or 
      electropermeabilized. To achieve successful adaptation and survival of a grafted 
      organ, the alloreactive T cells that induce graft rejection must be regulated. 
      Corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and mTOR inhibitors, which are systemic 
      immunosuppressants, are currently used for transplantation, with significant side 
      effects. In this study, we demonstrated that a cell-permeable peptide (CPP), 
      dNP2, could efficiently deliver proteins into human CD4 and CD8 T cells. We 
      confirmed regulatory functioning of the cytoplasmic domain of CTLA-4 conjugated 
      with dNP2 (dNP2-ctCTLA-4) in human T cell activation, proliferation, and 
      chemokine receptor expression. We utilized a human skin allograft system in 
      SCID/beige mice to examine whether dNP2-ctCTLA-4 could inhibit allograft 
      rejection by controlling T cell responses. The grafted skin tissue inflammation, 
      allogeneic T cell infiltration, and blood cytokine level was markedly reduced by 
      dNP2-ctCTLA-4, resulting in successful transplantation. In addition, it also 
      inhibited T cell alloresponses against microvessels formed form Bcl-2-transduced 
      human umbilical vein endothelial cells implanted into Balb/c 
      Rag1(-/-)/IL-2Rγ(-/-) double knockout (DKO) mice, assessed as reduced T cell 
      infiltration and granzyme B expression. These results collectively suggest that 
      dNP2 peptide conjugation offers a valuable tool for delivering macromolecules 
      like proteins into human T cells, and dNP2-ctCTLA-4 is a novel agent that shows 
      potential in controlling human T cell responses to allow successful adaptation of 
      grafted tissues.

AB  - Immunological rejection is an important factor resulting in allograft 
      dysfunction, and more valid therapeutic methods need to be explored to improve 
      allograft outcomes. Many researches have indicated that artemisinin and its 
      derivative exhibits immunosuppressive functions, apart from serving as a 
      traditional anti-malarial drug. In this assay, we further explored the 
      therapeutic effects of artemisinin for transplant rejection in a rat cardiac 
      transplantation model. We found that it markedly attenuated allograft rejection 
      and histological injury and significantly prolonged the survival of allograft. 
      Upon further exploring the mechanism, we demonstrated that artemisinin not only 
      attenuated T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) by reducing effector T cell 
      infiltration and inflammatory cytokine secretion and increasing regulatory T cell 
      infiltration and immunoregulatory cytokine levels, but also attenuated 
      antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) through inhibition of B cells activation and 
      antibody production. Furthermore, artemisinin also reduced macrophage 
      infiltration in allografts, which was determined to be important for TCMR and 
      ABMR. Moreover, we demonstrated that artemisinin significantly inhibited the 
      function of pure T cells, B cells, and macrophages in vitro. All in all, this 
      study provide evidence that artemisinin significantly attenuates TCMR and ABMR by 
      targeting multiple effectors. Therefore, this agent might have potential for use 
      in clinical settings to protect against transplant rejection.

AB  - Injection of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) complexed with a particular anti-IL-2 
      monoclonal antibody (mab) JES6-1 has been shown to selectively expand 
      CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vivo. Although the potency of this 
      approach with regard to transplantation has already been proven in an islet 
      transplantation model, skin graft survival could not be prolonged. Since the 
      latter is relevant to human allograft survival, we sought to improve the 
      efficiency of IL-2 complex (cplx) treatment for skin allograft survival in a 
      stringent murine skin graft model. Here, we show that combining low doses of IL-2 
      cplxs with rapamycin and blockade of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 leads to 
      long-term (>75 d) survival of major histocompatibility complex-different skin 
      allografts without the need for immunosuppression. Allograft survival was 
      critically dependent on CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs and was not accompanied by impaired 
      responsiveness toward donor alloantigens in vitro after IL-2 cplx treatment was 
      stopped. Furthermore, second donor-type skin grafts were rejected and provoked 
      rejection of the primary graft, suggesting that operational tolerance is not 
      systemic but restricted to the graft. These findings plus the lack of 
      donor-specific antibody formation imply that prolonged graft survival was largely 
      a reflection of immunological ignorance. The results may represent a potentially 
      clinically translatable strategy for the development of protocols for tolerance 
      induction.

LID - 7838 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the fluctuation patterns of Th17 and IL-17 cytokines 
      during acute skin graft rejection in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preparations 
      for mouse skin transplantation model. At days 1, 3, 5, and 7 post-grafting, the 
      number of Th17 cells in the spleens was quantified by flow cytometry (FCM); IL-17 
      mRNA expression in the spleens and the skin grafts were analyzed by 
      semiquantitative RT-PCR. Serum IL-17 levels were determined by enzyme-labeled 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The number of Th17 cells in the spleens 
      gradually increased and peaked at day 7 post-grafting. IL-17 mRNA expression in 
      the skin was strongest at day 5 post-grafting. IL-17 levels in peripheral blood 
      was highest at day 5 post-grafting. CONCLUSIONS: Acute rejection of allogeneic 
      skin grafts in mice may correlate with the number of Th17 lymphocytes and the 
      secretion of cytokine IL-17. Th17 cell count and IL-17 level may serve as 
      important reference indices for early rejection reactions after skin grafting.

TI  - IL-27 Rα(+) cells promoted allorejection via enhancing STAT1/3/5 phosphorylation.
PG  - 10756-10767

AB  - Recently, emerging evidence strongly suggested that the activation of 
      interleukin-27 Receptor α (IL-27Rα) could modulate different inflammatory 
      diseases. However, whether IL-27Rα affects allotransplantation rejection is not 
      fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of IL-27Rα on allorejection both 
      in vivo and in vitro. The skin allotransplantation mice models were established, 
      and the dynamic IL-27Rα/IL-27 expression was detected, and IL-27Rα(+) spleen 
      cells adoptive transfer was performed. STAT1/3/5 phosphorylation, proliferation 
      and apoptosis were investigated in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) with 
      recombinant IL-27 (rIL-27) stimulation. Finally, IFN-γ/ IL-10 in graft/serum from 
      model mice was detected. Results showed higher IL-27Rα/IL-27 expression in 
      allografted group compared that syngrafted group on day 10 (top point of 
      allorejection). IL-27Rα(+) spleen cells accelerated allograft rejection in vivo. 
      rIL-27 significantly promoted proliferation, inhibited apoptosis and increased 
      STAT1/3/5 phosphorylation of alloreactive splenocytes, and these effects of 
      rIL-27 could be almost totally blocked by JAK/ STAT inhibitor and anti-IL-27 p28 
      Ab. Finally, higher IL-27Rα(+) IFN-γ(+) cells and lower IL-27Rα(+) IL-10(+) cells 
      within allografts, and high IFN-γ/low IL-10 in serum of allorejecting mice were 
      detected. In conclusion, these data suggested that IL-27Rα(+) cells apparently 
      promoted allograft rejection through enhancing alloreactive proliferation, 
      inhibiting apoptosis and up-regulating IFN-γ via enhancing STAT pathway. Blocking 
      IL-27 pathway may favour to prevent allorejection, and IL-27Rα may be as a high 
      selective molecule for targeting diagnosis and therapy for allotransplantation 
      rejection.

AB  - In vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA), invasive tissue biopsies 
      remain the gold standard in diagnosing rejection carrying significant morbidity. 
      We aimed to show feasibility of tape-stripping for noninvasive immune monitoring 
      in VCA. Tape-stripping was performed on allografts and native skin of upper 
      extremity transplant recipients. Healthy nontransplanted individuals served as 
      controls. The technique was also used in swine on naïve skin in nontransplanted 
      animals, native skin of treated, transplanted swine, nonrejecting VCAs, and 
      rejecting VCAs. Extracted protein was analyzed for differences in cytokine 
      expression using Luminex technology. Significantly decreased levels of INFγ and 
      IL-1Ra were seen between human allograft samples and native skin. In swine, 
      rejecting grafts had increased IL-1Ra compared to naïve and native skin, 
      decreased levels of GM-CSF compared to native skin, and decreased IL-10 compared 
      to nonrejecting grafts. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed rejecting 
      grafts separated from the nonrejecting (P = 0.021). Variable importance in 
      projection scores identified GM-CSF, IL-1Ra, and IL-2 as the most important 
      profiles for group discrimination. Differences in cytokine expression are 
      detectable in human VCA patient native skin and VCA graft skin using a 
      noninvasive tape-stripping method. Swine studies suggest that differences in 
      cytokines between rejecting and nonrejecting grafts are discernable.

AB  - Activated γδ T cells have been shown to accelerate allograft rejection. However, 
      the precise role of skin-resident γδ T cells and their subsets-Vγ5 (epidermis), 
      Vγ1, and Vγ4 (dermis)-in skin graft rejection have not been identified. Here, 
      using a male to female skin transplantation model, we demonstrated that Vγ4 T 
      cells, rather than Vγ1 or Vγ5 T cells, accelerated skin graft rejection and that 
      IL-17A was essential for Vγ4 T-cell-mediated skin graft rejection. Moreover, we 
      found that Vγ4 T cells were required for early IL-17A production in the 
      transplanted area, both in skin grafts and in the host epidermis around grafts. 
      Additionally, the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20-chemokine receptor 6 pathway 
      was essential for recruitment of Vγ4 T cells to the transplantation area, whereas 
      both IL-1β and IL-23 induced IL-17A production from infiltrating cells. Lastly, 
      Vγ4 T-cell-derived IL-17A promoted the accumulation of mature dendritic cells in 
      draining lymph nodes to subsequently regulate αβ T-cell function after skin graft 
      transplantation. Taken together, our data reveal that Vγ4 T cells accelerate skin 
      graft rejection by providing an early source of IL-17A.

TI  - Preclinical efficacy of stem cell therapy for skin flap: a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A skin flap is one of the most critical surgical techniques for the 
      restoration of cutaneous defects. However, the distal necrosis of the skin flap 
      severely restricts the clinical application of flap surgery. As there is no 
      consensus on the treatment methods to prevent distal necrosis of skin flaps, more 
      effective and feasible interventions to prevent skin flaps from necrosis are 
      urgently needed. Stem therapy as a potential method to improve the survival rate 
      of skin flaps is receiving increasing attention. METHODS: This review followed 
      the recommendations from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statements. Twenty studies with 500 animals were included 
      by searching Web of Science, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases, up 
      until October 8, 2020. Moreover, the references of the included articles were 
      searched manually to obtain other studies. All analyses were conducted using 
      Review Manager V.5.3 software. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of all 20 studies 
      demonstrated stem cell treatment has significant effects on reducing necrosis of 
      skin flap compared with the control group (SMD: 3.20, 95% CI 2.47 to 3.93). 
      Besides, subgroup analysis showed differences in the efficacy of stem cells in 
      improving the survival rate of skin flaps in areas of skin flap, cell type, 
      transplant types, and method of administration of stem cells. The meta-analysis 
      also showed that stem cell treatment had a significant effect on increasing blood 
      vessel density (SMD: 2.96, 95% CI 2.21 to 3.72) and increasing the expression of 
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, SMD: 4.34, 95% CI 2.48 to 6.1). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The preclinical evidence of our systematic review indicate that stem 
      cell-based therapy is effective for promoting early angiogenesis by up regulating 
      VEGF and ultimately improving the survival rate of skin flap. In summary, small 
      area skin flap, the administration method of intra-arterial injection, ASCs and 
      MSCs, and xenogenic stem cells from humans showed more effective for the survival 
      of animal skin flaps. In general, stem cell-based therapy may be a promising 
      method to prevent skin flap necrosis.

TI  - Impact of dermal matrix thickness on split-thickness skin graft survival and 
      wound contraction in a single-stage procedure.
PG  - 370-379
LID - 10.1111/iwj.13637 [doi]
AB  - Optimal treatment of full-thickness skin injuries requires dermal and epidermal 
      replacement. To spare donor dermis, dermal substitutes can be used ahead of 
      split-thickness skin graft (STSG) application. However, this two-stage procedure 
      requires an additional general anaesthetic, often prolongs hospitalisation, and 
      increases outpatient services. Although a few case series have described 
      successful single-stage reconstructions, with application of both STSG and dermal 
      substitute at the index operation, we have little understanding of how the 
      physical characteristics of dermal substitutes affects the success of a 
      single-stage procedure. Here, we evaluated several dermal substitutes to optimise 
      single-stage skin replacement in a preclinical porcine model. A porcine 
      full-thickness excisional wound model was used to evaluate the following dermal 
      substitutes: autologous dermal graft (ADG; thicknesses 0.15-0.60 mm), Integra 
      (0.4-0.8 mm), Alloderm (0.9-1.6 mm), and chitosan-based hydrogel (0.1-0.2 mm). 
      After excision, each wound was treated with either a dermal substitute followed 
      by STSG or STSG alone (control). Endpoints included graft take at postoperative 
      days (PODs) 7 and 14, wound closure at POD 28, and wound contracture from POD 
      28-120. Graft take was highest in the STSG alone and hydrogel groups at POD 14 
      (86.9% ± 19.5% and 81.3% ± 12.3%, respectively; P < .001). There were no 
      differences in graft take at POD 7 or in wound closure at POD 28, though highest 
      rates of wound closure were seen in the STSG alone and hydrogel groups 
      (93.6% ± 9.1% and 99.8% ± 0.5%, respectively). ADG-treated wounds demonstrated 
      the least amount of wound contracture at each time point. Increase dermal 
      substitute thickness was associated with worse percent graft take at PODs 14 and 
      28 (Spearman ρ of -0.50 and -0.45, respectively; P < .001). In this preclinical 
      single-stage skin reconstruction model, thinner ADG and hydrogel dermal 
      substitutes outperformed thicker dermal substitutes. Both substitute thickness 
      and composition affect treatment success. Further preclinical and clinical 
      studies to optimise this treatment modality are warranted.

      and attenuates acute rejection in murine skin and heart transplantation.
PG  - 8051-8060
LID - 10.7150/thno.43507 [doi]
AB  - Background: The immune checkpoint cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), 
      induced upon T cell activation but degraded quickly, has been targeted in the 
      clinical therapy of advanced cancers and autoimmune diseases. However, whether 
      inhibiting CTLA-4 degradation ameliorates transplant rejection remains unknown. 
      Methods: The CTLA-4 expression in activated murine T cells treated with the 
      inhibitors mediating protein degradation was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). 
      CD45.1 mice, which received TEa T cells and underwent heart transplantation, were 
      administrated with the inhibitor. Subsequently, CTLA-4 expression of TEa T cells 
      was analyzed. Murine skin and heart transplantation models were built, then the 
      survival and histopathology of the allografts, and T cell subsets in the spleens 
      of each group were compared. Results: Chloroquine (CQ) was identified as an 
      inhibitor of CTLA-4 degradation, which augmented both surface and total CTLA-4 
      expression in T cells. It considerably prolonged the skin and heart allograft 
      survival time and reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells in allografts. 
      Besides decreasing the frequencies of the CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector T cells, 
      especially IFN-γ producing T cells, CQ also increased the proportion of 
      regulatory T cells in the spleen. The CTLA-4 blockade abrogated the benefits of 
      CQ on the survival of heart allografts. Moreover, CQ enhanced CTLA-4 expression 
      in activated human T cells and reduced the secretion of IFN-γ in human mixed 
      lymphocyte reaction. Conclusion: Targeting CTLA-4 degradation provides a novel 
      means to prevent transplant rejection and induce transplant tolerance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autologous split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs) are the standard of 
      care for closure of deep and large burns. However, perforation and extensive 
      fishnet-like expansion of the grafts to achieve greater area wound coverage can 
      lead to treatment failures or esthetically poor healing outcomes and scarring. 
      The purpose of this study was to validate an autologous advanced therapy 
      medicinal product (ATMP)-compliant skin cell suspension and evaluate its efficacy 
      to promote epithelialization. METHODS: Cells isolated from a piece of STSG 
      according to ATMP classification requirements were sprayed onto 20 patients 
      during a single operation in a validation study. Comparative evaluation of 
      treatment efficacy was carried out using side-by-side skin graft donor site 
      wounds that were standardized in depth. Firstly, we characterized wound healing 
      transcriptomes at 14 and 21 days from serial wound biopsies in seven patients. 
      Then, side-by-side wounds in four patients were treated with or without the skin 
      cells. The wounds were photographed, clinical outcomes assessed, and the 
      treatment and control wound transcriptomes at 14 days were compared to the 
      untreated wounds' healing transcriptomes. RESULTS: The average cell yield after 
      isolation from the STSG was 2.4 × 10(6) cells/cm(2) with 96 % viability. The 
      product contained mainly keratinocytes and their precursors but also other skin 
      cells such as fibroblasts were present. As compared to vehicle-treated donor site 
      wounds, the wounds treated with cells demonstrated improved epithelialization by 
      both direct comparison and machine learning analysis of the transcriptomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We showed that rapid and scalable ATMP-classified processing of skin 
      cells is feasible, and application of the skin cells effectively promotes healing 
      and epithelization of donor site wounds.

AB  - Oral antigen exposure is a powerful, non-invasive route to induce immune 
      tolerance to dietary antigens, and has been modestly successful at prolonging 
      graft survival in rodent models of transplantation. To harness the mechanisms of 
      oral tolerance for promoting long-term graft acceptance, we developed a mouse 
      model where the antigen ovalbumin (OVA) was introduced orally prior to 
      transplantation with skin grafts expressing OVA. Oral OVA treatment 
      pre-transplantation promoted permanent graft acceptance and linked tolerance to 
      skin grafts expressing OVA fused to the additional antigen 2W. Tolerance was 
      donor-specific, as secondary donor-matched, but not third-party allografts were 
      spontaneously accepted. Oral OVA treatment promoted an anergic phenotype in 
      OVA-reactive CD4(+) and CD8(+) conventional T cells (Tconvs) and expanded 
      OVA-reactive Tregs pre-transplantation. However, skin graft acceptance following 
      oral OVA resisted partial depletion of Tregs and blockade of PD-L1. 
      Mechanistically, we revealed a role for the proximal gut draining lymph nodes 
      (gdLNs) in mediating this effect, as an intestinal infection that drains to the 
      proximal gdLNs prevented tolerance induction. Our study extends previous work 
      applying oral antigen exposure to transplantation and serves as proof of concept 
      that the systemic immune mechanisms supporting oral tolerance are sufficient to 
      promote long-term graft acceptance.

TI  - Vitiligo management: combination of surgical treatment and phototherapy under 
      reflectance confocal microscopy monitoring.
PG  - 7366-7371

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vitiligo is a chronic acquired pigmentary skin disorder characterized 
      by well-defined asymptomatic white macule as a result of loss of functional 
      melanocytes in the epidermis. The psychological burden experienced by patients is 
      of great interest and consequently research of the best medical approach is 
      constantly developing. This review focuses on surgical approach and the 
      combination of surgery and phototherapy. In addition, reflectance confocal 
      microscopy (RCM) could be useful to discriminate between stable or active 
      vitiligo and to evaluate efficacy of therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched 
      PubMed with the following keywords: (vitiligo[Title/Abstract]) AND 
      therapy[Title/Abstract]) AND surgery[Title/Abstract]) AND 
      phototherapy[Title/Abstract]) AND reflectance confocal 
      microscopy[Title/Abstract]). RESULTS: To date, surgery is an effective 
      therapeutic approach in stable vitiligo. Phototherapy, which is the most 
      effective medical option, can improve the results obtained with surgery if 
      performed in combination. Preliminary data show that RCM help physician in 
      evaluating stability of vitiligo and is also useful to monitor clinical response. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Vitiligo is a psychosocially debilitating disease requiring a 
      multidisciplinary approach. Even if a standard management could not be stated, 
      combination of surgery and phototherapy in stable vitiligo could lead to great 
      improvement than monotherapy. RCM is a modern tool which should be used in order 
      to perform surgery and phototherapy properly and to subsequently evaluate 
      efficacy on a microscopic level.

TI  - Survival of Allogeneic Self-Assembled Cultured Skin.
PG  - 2071-8
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000001353 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficiency of autologous skin for reconstruction of severe wounds is 
      a major problem in plastic surgery. Autologous substitutes can provide additional 
      coverage, but due to the duration of production, treatment is significantly 
      delayed. The allogeneic approach offers a potential of having an off-the-shelf 
      solution for the immediate application. METHODS: In this study, we assess the 
      engraftment and immunogenicity of allogeneic bilayered bioengineered skin 
      prepared by a self-assembly method. Bioengineered skin has the potential 
      immunological advantage of lacking passenger leukocytes including 
      antigen-presenting cells. The skin constructs were transplanted across major 
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) barriers in a porcine animal model. Animals 
      received a second grafting of the same skin construct 7 weeks after the first set 
      of grafts together with MHC-matched constructs to assess for clinical 
      sensitization. RESULTS: All alloconstructs successfully engrafted with histologic 
      evidence of neovascularization by day 4. Complete cellular rejection and tissue 
      loss occurred by day 8 for most grafts. After the second application, accelerated 
      rejection (<4 days) took place with the development of swine MHC-specific 
      cytotoxic alloantibody. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate preclinically that 
      self-assembled allogeneic constructs engraft and reject similar to allogeneic 
      skin despite the absence of professional donor antigen-presenting cells.

LID - 10.1111/ajt.14765 [doi]
AB  - Cytokine-expression profiles revealed IL-1ß highly upregulated in rejecting skin 
      of limb allografts. We investigate the effect of intragraft treatment with a 
      neutralizing IL-1β antibody in limb transplantation. Following allogenic 
      hind-limb transplantation, Lewis rats were either left untreated or treated with 
      anti-lymphocyte serum + tacrolimus (baseline); baseline immunosuppression + 
      anti-IL-1β (1 mg/kg once/week, 6-8 subcutaneous injections) into the transplanted 
      or contralateral limb. Endpoint was rejection grade III or day 100. Graft 
      rejection was assessed by histology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry 
      phenotyping of immune cells, and monitoring cytokine expression. Anti-IL-1β 
      injections into the allograft or contralateral limb resulted in a significant 
      delay of rejection onset (controls: 58.60 ± 0.60; group 3: 75.80 ± 10.87, 
      P = .044; group 4: 73.00 ± 6.49, P = .008) and prolongation of graft survival 
      (controls: 64.60 ± 0.87; group 3: 86.60 ± 5.33, P = .002; group 4: 93.20 ± 3.82, 
      P = .002), compared to controls. Although the phenotype of the graft infiltrating 
      immune cells did not differ between groups, significantly decreased skin protein 
      levels of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-13, IP-10, MCP-1, and MCP-3 in long-term-survivors 
      indicate an overall decrease of chemoattraction and infiltration of immune cells 
      as the immunosuppressive mechanism of anti-IL-1β. Inhibition of IL-1β with 
      short-term systemic immunosuppression prolongs limb allograft survival and 
      represents a promising target for immunosuppression in extremity transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Foot ulceration is a major problem in people with diabetes and is the 
      leading cause of hospitalisation and limb amputations. Skin grafts and tissue 
      replacements can be used to reconstruct skin defects for people with diabetic 
      foot ulcers in addition to providing them with standard care. Skin substitutes 
      can consist of bioengineered or artificial skin, autografts (taken from the 
      patient), allografts (taken from another person) or xenografts (taken from 
      animals). OBJECTIVES: To determine the benefits and harms of skin grafting and 
      tissue replacement for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes. SEARCH 
      METHODS: In April 2015 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); 
      Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid 
      EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched clinical trial registries to identify 
      ongoing studies. We did not apply restrictions to language, date of publication 
      or study setting. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of skin 
      grafts or tissue replacements for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and 
      assessed the quality of the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included seventeen 
      studies with a total of 1655 randomised participants in this review. Risk of bias 
      was variable among studies. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome 
      assessment was not possible in most trials because of obvious differences between 
      the treatments. The lack of a blinded outcome assessor may have caused detection 
      bias when ulcer healing was assessed. However, possible detection bias is hard to 
      prevent due to the nature of the skin replacement products we assessed, and the 
      fact that they are easily recognisable. Strikingly, nearly all studies (15/17) 
      reported industry involvement; at least one of the authors was connected to a 
      commercial organisation or the study was funded by a commercial organisation. In 
      addition, the funnel plot for assessing risk of bias appeared to be asymmetrical; 
      suggesting that small studies with 'negative' results are less likely to be 
      published.Thirteen of the studies included in this review compared a skin graft 
      or tissue replacement with standard care. Four studies compared two grafts or 
      tissue replacements with each other. When we pooled the results of all the 
      individual studies, the skin grafts and tissue replacement products that were 
      used in the trials increased the healing rate of foot ulcers in patients with 
      diabetes compared to standard care (risk ratio (RR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 1.30 to 1.85, low quality of evidence). However, the strength of effect was 
      variable depending on the specific product that was used (e.g. EpiFix® RR 11.08, 
      95% CI 1.69 to 72.82 and OrCel® RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 5.05). Based on the four 
      included studies that directly compared two products, no specific type of skin 
      graft or tissue replacement showed a superior effect on ulcer healing over 
      another type of skin graft or tissue replacement.Sixteen of the included studies 
      reported on adverse events in various ways. No study reported a statistically 
      significant difference in the occurrence of adverse events between the 
      intervention and the control group.Only two of the included studies reported on 
      total incidence of lower limb amputations. We found fewer amputations in the 
      experimental group compared with the standard care group when we pooled the 
      results of these two studies, although the absolute risk reduction for amputation 
      was small (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.81; risk difference (RD) -0.06, 95% CI -0.10 
      to -0.01, very low quality of evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the 
      studies included in this review, the overall therapeutic effect of skin grafts 
      and tissue replacements used in conjunction with standard care shows an increase 
      in the healing rate of foot ulcers and slightly fewer amputations in people with 
      diabetes compared with standard care alone. However, the data available to us was 
      insufficient for us to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of different types 
      of skin grafts or tissue replacement therapies. In addition, evidence of long 
      term effectiveness is lacking and cost-effectiveness is uncertain.

PG  - 646-661
LID - 10.1111/ajt.15083 [doi]
AB  - Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex (mTORC)1 and mTORC2 regulate the 
      differentiation and function of immune cells. While inhibition of mTORC1 
      antagonizes dendritic cell (DC) differentiation and suppresses graft rejection, 
      the role of mTORC2 in DCs in determining host responses to transplanted tissue 
      remains undefined. Using a mouse model in which mTORC2 was deleted specifically 
      in CD11c(+) DCs (TORC2(DC-/-) ), we show that the transplant of minor 
      histocompatibility Ag (HY)-mismatched skin grafts from TORC2(DC-/-) donors into 
      wild-type recipients results in accelerated rejection characterized by enhanced 
      CD8(+) T cell responses in the graft and regional lymphoid tissue [Correction 
      added on January 9, 2019, after first online publication: in the previous 
      sentence, major was changed to minor]. Similar enhancement of CD8(+) effector T 
      cell responses was observed in MHC-mismatched recipients of TORC2(DC-/-) grafts. 
      Augmented CD8(+) T cell responses were also observed in a delayed-type 
      hypersensitivity model in which mTORC2 was absent in cutaneous DCs. These 
      elevated responses could be ascribed to an increased T cell stimulatory phenotype 
      of TORC2(DC-/-) and not to enhanced lymph node homing of the cells. In contrast, 
      rejection of ovalbumin transgenic skin grafts in TORC2(DC-/-) recipients was 
      unaffected. These findings suggest that mTORC2 in skin DCs restrains effector 
      CD8(+) T cell responses and have implications for understanding of the influence 
      of mTOR inhibitors that target mTORC2 in transplant.

TI  - Immunosuppressive effect of the gut microbiome altered by high-dose tacrolimus in 
      mice.
PG  - 1646-1656
LID - 10.1111/ajt.14661 [doi]
AB  - The alterations induced in gut microbiota by tacrolimus may affect immune 
      function and organ transplantation. Mice were treated with high-dose tacrolimus 
      for 14 days. The fecal microbiota were analyzed by pyrosequencing the 16S rRNA 
      genes, and the effect on metabolism was predicted using the sequence data. The 
      subgroups of T cells in the serum, gut-associated lymphoid tissue, and draining 
      lymph nodes were determined by flow cytometry. Tacrolimus treatment significantly 
      altered the relative abundance of Allobaculum, Bacteroides, and Lactobacillus and 
      CD4(+) CD25(hi) FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells in the colonic mucosa and the 
      circulation. These were significantly increased after either tacrolimus treatment 
      or treatment by fecal microbiota transfer from tacrolimus-treated donors. 
      Further, treatment with low-dose tacrolimus plus fecal microbiota transfer from 
      high-dose tacrolimus-altered mice increased skin allograft survival rate in a 
      skin transplantation model. Thus, high-dose tacrolimus alters the compositions 
      and taxa of the gut microbiota. Administration of these conditioned gut 
      microbiota plus low-dose tacrolimus resulted in regulation of colonic and 
      systemic immune responses and an increased allograft survival rate. This study 
      demonstrated a new strategy for controlling allograft rejection by combining an 
      immunosuppressive agent with gut microbiome transplantation.

PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0474-8 [doi]
LID - 96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant recipients show heterogeneity in the 
      occurrence and timing of acute rejection episodes. Understanding the factors 
      responsible for such variability in patient outcomes may lead to improved 
      diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Rejection kinetics of transplanted organs 
      mainly depends on the extent of genetic disparities between donor and recipient, 
      but a role for environmental factors is emerging. We have recently shown that 
      major alterations of the microbiota following broad-spectrum antibiotics, or use 
      of germ-free animals, promoted longer skin graft survival in mice. Here, we 
      tested whether spontaneous differences in microbial colonization between 
      genetically similar individuals can contribute to variability in graft rejection 
      kinetics. RESULTS: We compared rejection kinetics of minor mismatched skin grafts 
      in C57BL/6 mice from Jackson Laboratory (Jax) and Taconic Farms (Tac), 
      genetically similar animals colonized by different commensal microbes. Female Tac 
      mice rejected skin grafts from vendor-matched males more quickly than Jax mice. 
      We observed prolonged graft survival in Tac mice when they were exposed to Jax 
      mice microbiome through co-housing or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) by 
      gastric gavage. In contrast, exposure to Tac mice did not change graft rejection 
      kinetics in Jax mice, suggesting a dominant suppressive effect of Jax microbiota. 
      High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from Jax and Tac mice fecal 
      samples confirmed a convergence of microbiota composition after cohousing or 
      fecal transfer. Our analysis of amplicon data associated members of a single 
      bacterial genus, Alistipes, with prolonged graft survival. Consistent with this 
      finding, members of the genus Alistipes were absent in a separate Tac cohort, in 
      which fecal transfer from Jax mice failed to prolong graft survival. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results demonstrate that differences in resident microbiome in healthy 
      individuals may translate into distinct kinetics of graft rejection, and 
      contribute to interpersonal variability in graft outcomes. The association 
      between Alistipes and prolonged skin graft survival in mice suggests that members 
      of this genus might affect host physiology, including at sites distal to the 
      gastrointestinal tract. Overall, these findings allude to a potential therapeutic 
      role for specific gut microbes to promote graft survival through the 
      administration of probiotics, or FMT.

      and biomarkers. METHODS: Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into four 
      groups: control (CT) and treated with pentoxifylline (P1, P3 and P5). Modified 
      McFarlane technique flap was used. Ten days later, the animals were euthanized 
      and the areas of viable and necrotic tissue were evaluated. Hematoxylin/eosin 
      staining was used to assess the morphometric characteristics of the number of 
      vessels and epithelial thickness. Picrosirius red was used to assess collagen 
      density. VEGF and TGF-?1 levels on the skin flap and serum of the animals were 
      measured by the ELISA method. RESULTS: The macroscopic evaluation of the skin 
      flap dimensions showed reduced necrotic tissue in the pentoxifylline (p < 0.05) 
      treated groups. There was an increase in angiogenesis and reepithelization, 
      demonstrated by analyses with an increased number of vessels (p < 0.05), VEGF and 
      epithelial thickness. Fibrogenic effect showed decreased collagen density and 
      TGF-β1 in the skin flap and serum. CONCLUSION: The benefits of pentoxifylline 
      administered by subcutaneous route, at dose 100 mg/kg, which was effective to 
      improve the survival of skin flap by acting on tissue repair components, 
      stimulating angiogenesis and reepithelization, in addition to reducing 
      fibrogenesis.

      Development of Regulatory T Cells and Mixed Chimerism.

AB  - Vascularized composite allografts contain various tissue components and possess 
      relative antigenicity, eliciting different degrees of alloimmune responses. To 
      investigate the strategies for achieving facial allograft tolerance, we 
      established a mouse hemiface transplant model, including the skin, muscle, 
      mandible, mucosa, and vessels. However, the immunomodulatory effects of the 
      mandible on facial allografts remain unclear. To understand the effects of the 
      mandible on facial allograft survival, we compared the diversities of different 
      facial allograft-elicited alloimmunity between a facial osteomyocutaneous 
      allograft (OMC), including skin, muscle, oral mucosa, and vessels, and especially 
      the mandible, and a myocutaneous allograft (MC) including the skin, muscle, oral 
      mucosa, and vessels, but not the mandible. The different facial allografts of a 
      BALB/c donor were transplanted into a heterotopic neck defect on fully major 
      histocompatibility complex-mismatched C57BL/6 mice. The allogeneic OMC (Allo-OMC) 
      group exhibited significant prolongation of facial allograft survival compared to 
      the allogeneic MC group, both in the presence and absence of FK506 
      immunosuppressive drugs. With the use of FK506 monotherapy (2 mg/kg) for 21 days, 
      the allo-OMC group, including the mandible, showed prolongation of facial 
      allograft survival of up to 65 days, whereas the myocutaneous allograft, without 
      the mandible, only survived for 34 days. The Allo-OMC group also displayed 
      decreased lymphocyte infiltration into the facial allograft. Both groups showed 
      similar percentages of B cells, T cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, and 
      dendritic cells in the blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. However, a decrease in 
      pro-inflammatory T helper 1 cells and an increase in anti-inflammatory regulatory 
      T cells were observed in the blood and lymph nodes of the Allo-OMC group. 
      Significantly increased percentages of donor immune cells were also observed in 
      three lymphoid organs of the Allo-OMC group, suggesting mixed chimerism 
      induction. These results indicated that the mandible has the potential to induce 
      anti-inflammatory effects and mixed chimerism for prolonging facial allograft 
      survival. The immunomodulatory understanding of the mandible could contribute to 
      reducing the use of immunosuppressive regimens in clinical face 
      allotransplantation including the mandible.

AB  - A transplanted organ is usually rejected without any major immunosuppressive 
      treatment because of vigorous alloimmune responsiveness. However, continuous 
      global immunosuppression may cause severe side effects, including nephrotoxicity, 
      tumors, and infections. Therefore, it is necessary to seek novel 
      immunosuppressive agents, especially natural ingredients that may provide 
      sufficient efficacy in immunosuppression with minimal side effects. Shikonin is a 
      bioactive naphthoquinone pigment, an ingredient originally extracted from the 
      root of Lithospermum erythrorhizon. Previous studies have shown that shikonin 
      regulates immunity and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. In particular, it can 
      ameliorate arthritis in animal models. However, it is unclear whether shikonin 
      inhibits alloimmunity or allograft rejection. In this study and for the first 
      time, we demonstrated that shikonin significantly prolonged the survival of skin 
      allografts in wild-type mice. Shikonin increased the frequencies of 
      CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) post-transplantation and induced 
      CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in vitro as well. Importantly, depleting the Tregs abrogated 
      the extension of skin allograft survival induced by shikonin. It also decreased 
      the frequencies of CD8(+)CD44(high)CD62L(low) effector T cells and 
      CD11c(+)CD80(+)/CD11c(+)CD86(+) mature DCs after transplantation. Moreover, we 
      found that shikonin inhibited the proliferation of T cells in vitro and 
      suppressed their mTOR signaling. It also reduced the gene expression of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFNγ, IL-6, TNFα, and IL-17A, while 
      increasing the gene expression of anti-inflammatory mediators IL-10, TGF-β1, and 
      indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) in skin allografts. Further, shikonin 
      downregulated IDO protein expression in skin allografts and DCs in vitro. Taken 
      together, shikonin inhibits allograft rejection via upregulating CD4(+)Foxp3(+) 
      Tregs. Thus, shikonin is a novel immunosuppressant that could be potentially used 
      in clinical transplantation.

TI  - Short-term MyD88 inhibition ameliorates cardiac graft rejection and promotes 
      donor-specific hyporesponsiveness of skin grafts in mice.
PG  - 941-52
LID - 10.1111/tri.12789 [doi]
AB  - Recognition of evolutionarily conserved ligands by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 
      triggers signaling cascades in innate immune cells to amplify adaptive immune 
      responses. Nearly all TLRs require MyD88 to transduce downstream signaling. MyD88 
      deficiency has been shown to promote the allograft acceptance in mice. However, 
      direct evidence for therapeutic potential of MyD88 inhibitors remains lacking. 
      Herein, we used a MyD88 inhibitor, namely ST2825, to explore its therapeutic 
      potential and mechanisms in fully allogeneic skin and heart transplant models. 
      Phenotypic maturation of dendritic cells stimulated by TLR ligands was alleviated 
      by ST2825 in parallel with reduced T-cell proliferation in vitro. A short-course 
      treatment with ST2825 significantly prolonged cardiac graft survival (mean 
      survival time = 18.5 ± 0.92 days vs. 7.25 ± 0.46 days). ST2825-treated group had 
      significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokines in allografts compared with 
      control group. ST2825 combined with anti-CD154 induced long-term skin allograft 
      acceptance in about one-third of recipients (>100 days). 'Skin-tolerant' 
      recipients showed attenuated donor-specific IFN-γ responses, intact IL-4 
      responses, and compromised alloantibody responses. We conclude that MyD88 
      inhibitor ST2825 attenuates acute cardiac rejection and promotes donor-specific 
      hyporesponsiveness in stringent skin transplant models. The direct evidence 
      suggests that pharmacological inhibition of MyD88 hold promising potential for 
      transplant rejection.

AB  - The first successful kidney transplant was done in 1954, and it remains the best 
      option for those with failed kidneys. However, the recipient's immune system 
      remains the most formidable barrier to transplantation, leading to rejection. 
      Rejection continues to be the most important reason of graft malfunction and 
      chronic renal allograft dysfunction and remains a challenge to date for 
      successful transplant survival. The current narrative review was planned to find 
      the best possible solution to the problem from among the different solutions 
      presented in literature related to allograft rejection since 1954.

LID - 10.1111/ajt.14087 [doi]
AB  - Immunosuppression in elderly recipients has been underappreciated in clinical 
      trials. Here, we assessed age-specific effects of the calcineurin inhibitor 
      tacrolimus (TAC) in a murine transplant model and assessed its clinical relevance 
      on human T cells. Old recipient mice exhibited prolonged skin graft survival 
      compared with young animals after TAC administration. More important, half of the 
      TAC dose was sufficient in old mice to achieve comparable systemic trough levels. 
      TAC administration was able to reduce proinflammatory interferon-γ cytokine 
      production and promote interleukin-10 production in old CD4(+) T cells. In 
      addition, TAC administration decreased interleukin-2 secretion in old CD4(+) T 
      cells more effectively while inhibiting the proliferation of CD4(+) T cells in 
      old mice. Both TAC-treated murine and human CD4(+) T cells demonstrated an 
      age-specific suppression of intracellular calcineurin levels and Ca(2+) influx, 
      two critical pathways in T cell activation. Of note, depletion of CD8(+) T cells 
      did not alter allograft survival outcome in old TAC-treated mice, suggesting that 
      TAC age-specific effects were mainly CD4(+) T cell mediated. Collectively, our 
      study demonstrates age-specific immunosuppressive capacities of TAC that are 
      CD4(+) T cell mediated. The suppression of calcineurin levels and Ca(2+) influx 
      in both old murine and human T cells emphasizes the clinical relevance of 
      age-specific effects when using TAC.

TI  - Monitoring Early-Stage Acute Rejection by Imaging CXCR3-Positive Cell 
      Infiltration: Evaluation of ¹²⁵Iodine-Labeled CXCL10.
PG  - 368-374
LID - 10.6002/ect.2019.0346 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It has been reported that CXCR3 is related to inflammatory cell 
      infiltration. The purpose of this study was to investigate iodine-125-labeled 
      CXCL10, a ligand of CXCR3, as a tracer targeting CXCR3 to detect acute rejection 
      in a mouse skin transplant model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The isograft and 
      allograft skin models were established with BALB/c and C57BL/6 mouse skin, 
      respectively, as donors and BALB/c mice as recipients. We used reverse 
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunochemistry staining to test 
      CXCR3 expression. ¹²⁵I-labeled CXCL10 was produced with the iodogenic method. 
      Allograft/isograft mice were examined with whole body autoradiography and ex vivo 
      biodistribution after tail vein injection of ¹²⁵I-labeled CXCL10 on day 8 
      posttransplant. RESULTS: CXCR3 expression was higher in allograft tissue than in 
      isograft control. ¹²⁵I-labeled CXCL10 was prepared with high specificity and 
      affinity. Biodistribution results showed higher ¹²⁵I-labeled CXCL10 uptake in 
      allograft tissue. The target-to-nontarget ratio was 3.01 ± 0.25 at 24 hours, a 
      result higher than that shown in the isograft group. Pharmacokinetic analyses of 
      ¹²⁵I-labeled CXCL10 showed that distribution half-life was 0.34 hour and the 
      elimination half-life was 9.83 hours. Dynamic whole body autoradiography images 
      of ¹²⁵I-labeled CXCL10 showed excellent graft visualization in the allograft 
      compared with the isograft group at all checking points, with visualization much 
      more obvious at 12 and 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CXCR3 is a 
      promising imaging target for immune cell infiltration in early-stage acute 
      rejection and ¹²⁵I-labeled CXCL10 can successfully image acute rejection with 
      good pharmacokinetics.

TI  - A Skin Rejection Grading System for Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation in 
      a Preclinical Large Animal Model.
PG  - 1385-1391
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000002695 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Banff Criteria have been accepted as a system for grading 
      histological rejection in graft skin in human vascularized composite 
      allotransplantation (VCA). Preclinical swine hindlimb transplantation models have 
      an important role in translational studies in VCA. However, unified grading 
      criteria for rejection in swine skin have not yet been established. METHODS: Two 
      hundred fourteen swine skin biopsy specimens were reviewed, including 88 native 
      skin biopsies and 126 specimens from the skin component of heterotopic swine 
      hindlimb transplants. Thorough review was performed in a blinded fashion by an 
      expert veterinary pathologist with attention paid to the applicability of the 
      Banff criteria as well as specific histologic characteristics and trends. 
      Clinical and histopathologic rejection scores were then directly compared. 
      RESULTS: Two hundred fourteen specimens reviewed showed significant similarities 
      between swine and human skin, as previously published. Notable swine-specific 
      characteristics, including paucicellular infiltration with rare epidermal cell 
      infiltration or necrosis, were accounted for in a proposed grading system that 
      parallels the Banff Criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive grading system, 
      based on the Banff Classification for skin rejection in VCA, provides a 
      standardized system for more accurate comparison of rejection in preclinical 
      swine VCA models.

      rejection remains unclear. Using a stringent mouse model of allogeneic kidney 
      transplantation, we demonstrated that acute allograft rejection occurred equally 
      in MyD88-sufficient (wild-type [WT]) and MyD88(-/-) recipients. However, MyD88 
      deficiency resulted in spontaneous diminution of graft infiltrating effector 
      cells, including CD11b(-)Gr-1(+) cells and activated CD8 T cells, as well as 
      subsequent restoration of near-normal renal graft function, leading to long-term 
      kidney allograft acceptance. Compared with T cells from WT recipients, T cells 
      from MyD88(-/-) recipients failed to mount a robust recall response upon donor 
      antigen restimulation in mixed lymphocyte cultures ex vivo. Notably, exogenous 
      IL-6 restored the proliferation rate of T cells, particularly CD8 T cells, from 
      MyD88(-/-) recipients to the proliferation rate of cells from WT recipients. 
      Furthermore, MyD88(-/-) T cells exhibited diminished expression of chemokine 
      receptors, specifically CCR4 and CXCR3, and the impaired ability to accumulate in 
      the kidney allografts despite an otherwise MyD88-sufficient environment. These 
      results provide a mechanism linking the lack of intrinsic MyD88 signaling in T 
      cells to the effective control of the rejection response that results in 
      spontaneous resolution of acute rejection and long-term graft protection.

TI  - Cryopreserved human skin allografts promote angiogenesis and dermal regeneration 
      in a murine model.
PG  - 925-936
LID - 10.1111/iwj.13349 [doi]
AB  - Cryopreserved human skin allografts (CHSAs) are used for the coverage of major 
      burns when donor sites for autografts are insufficiently available and have 
      clinically shown beneficial effects on chronic non-healing wounds. However, the 
      biologic mechanisms behind the regenerative properties of CHSA remain elusive. 
      Furthermore, the impact of cryopreservation on the immunogenicity of CHSA has not 
      been thoroughly investigated and raised concerns with regard to their clinical 
      application. To investigate the importance and fate of living cells, we compared 
      cryopreserved CHSA with human acellular dermal matrix (ADM) grafts in which 
      living cells had been removed by chemical processing. Both grafts were 
      subcutaneously implanted into C57BL/6 mice and explanted after 1, 3, 7, and 
      28 days (n = 5 per group). A sham surgery where no graft was implanted served as 
      a control. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and flow cytometry were used to 
      characterise the ultrastructure and cells within CHSA before implantation. 
      Immunofluorescent staining of tissue sections was used to determine the immune 
      reaction against the implanted grafts, the rate of apoptotic cells, and 
      vascularisation as well as collagen content of the overlaying murine dermis. 
      Digital quantification of collagen fibre alignment on tissue sections was used to 
      quantify the degree of fibrosis within the murine dermis. A substantial 
      population of live human cells with intact organelles was identified in CHSA 
      prior to implantation. Subcutaneous pockets with implanted xenografts or ADMs 
      healed without clinically apparent rejection and with a similar cellular immune 
      response. CHSA implantation largely preserved the cellularity of the overlying 
      murine dermis, whereas ADM was associated with a significantly higher rate of 
      cellular apoptosis, identified by cleaved caspase-3 staining, and a stronger 
      dendritic cell infiltration of the murine dermis. CHSA was found to induce a 
      local angiogenic response, leading to significantly more vascularisation of the 
      murine dermis compared with ADM and sham surgery on day 7. By day 28, aggregate 
      collagen-1 content within the murine dermis was greater following CHSA 
      implantation compared with ADM. Collagen fibre alignment of the murine dermis, 
      correlating with the degree of fibrosis, was significantly greater in the ADM 
      group, whereas CHSA maintained the characteristic basket weave pattern of the 
      native murine dermis. Our data indicate that CHSAs promote angiogenesis and 
      collagen-1 production without eliciting a significant fibrotic response in a 
      xenograft model. These findings may provide insight into the beneficial effects 
      clinically observed after treatment of chronic wounds and burns with CHSA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tipping the balance toward regulatory T cells (Tregs) through 
      adoptive cell therapy has shown promise to induce transplantation tolerance. 
      Although such strategy has been explored in many mice organ transplantation 
      studies, less knowledge was available in rat systems. Furthermore, the behaviors 
      of the transferred cells have not been well studied in real-time fashion. 
      METHODS: Tregs from naïve LEW rats were purified in two steps with the autoMACS 
      system. Immunosuppression potential of these cells was examined with mixed 
      lymphocyte reaction. Following stimulation by the alloantigen in vitro, the 
      purified Tregs were infused into the recipients of vascularized composite 
      allotransplantation (VCA). Secondary allogeneic skin grafting challenge was 
      performed on the recipients with long-term survived VCA. Live optical imaging was 
      performed to track luciferase-expressing Tregs following infusion to the VCA 
      recipients. Expression of relevant molecules was studied by flow cytometry or 
      quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Rat Tregs were enriched following two-step cell 
      sorting and showed immunosuppressive capacity. Upon infusion into the VCA 
      recipients that have been treated with antilymphocyte serum and short-term 
      Cyclosporin A, the antigen-stimulated Tregs significantly prolonged VCA survival 
      and induced donor-specific tolerance. Tracking of the infused bioluminescent 
      Tregs showed their specific homing to lymph nodes, and then to the VCAs. 
      Following secondary skin grafting, Tregs specifically gathered at the 
      donor-derived skin that was not rejected by the recipient. The in vivo migratory 
      pattern coincided with the altered expression of cell surface molecules of CD62L, 
      CD103, CD134, and CD278, following donor-antigen stimulation. Elevated expression 
      of CCR4 and CCL22 in allograft may also participate in recruiting Tregs for 
      maintenance of VCA survival and promoting donor-specific tolerance. CONCLUSION: 
      Sorted Tregs induced donor-specific tolerance to VCA in rats. Live cell tracking 
      demonstrated that activated CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs targeted primarily to the lymph 
      nodes and VCA. The Tregs migrated to the secondary grafted donor skin and 
      contributed to the maintenance of donor-specific tolerance. These behaviors were 
      associated with phenotypic changes induced by donor antigen stimulation. 
      Increased expression of CCR4 and CCL22 in VCA skin may also be relevant.

TI  - Short- and long-term efficacy of negative-pressure wound therapy in 
      split-thickness skin grafts: a retrospective study.
PG  - 2935-2947
LID - 10.21037/apm-20-1806 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Graft fixation is essential for the successful survival of skin 
      grafts. Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) can be utilized for fixing a skin 
      graft, ensuring adhesion of the graft with continuous and uniform pressure. 
      However, the reported short- and long-term efficacy of NPWT in split-thickness 
      skin grafts (STSGs) is inconsistent, with few studies on the long-term efficacy 
      (scar quality). To clarify the appropriate methods of skin graft fixation, we 
      conducted a single-center retrospective study on the shortand long-term effects 
      of skin grafting using different fixation methods. METHODS: This study 
      retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent STSG from December 2010 to June 
      2019. The patients were divided into two groups based on the skin graft-fixing 
      method: an NPWT group and a conventional mechanical fixation group. Medical data 
      including age, sex, underlying diseases, wound etiology, recipient site, surgical 
      methods, surgical outcomes, postoperative complications, and follow-up data 
      (Vancouver Scar Scale score and Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale score) 
      were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 392 cases were ultimately included in the 
      analysis. Among them, 218 cases were fixed with NPWT for skin grafting and 174 
      with conventional mechanical fixation. No significant differences in baseline 
      data were noted between the two groups. The total graft survival rate in the NPWT 
      group was higher than that in the conventional mechanical fixation group (86.7% 
      vs. 74.1%, P=0.002). Moreover, the infection rate in the NPWT group was lower 
      than that in the conventional mechanical fixation group (5.5% vs. 13.2%, 
      P=0.008). In terms of scar quality, no significant difference was observed, 
      except for in the hand. Overall, the scar surface regularity was better in the 
      NPWT group than in the control group. (P=0.019 for Patient Scar Assessment Scale, 
      P=0.025 for Observer Scar Assessment Scale). CONCLUSIONS: NPWT is an effective 
      approach for fixing skin grafts. Compared with conventional mechanical fixation, 
      NPWT can significantly improve the survival rate and reduce the infection rate of 
      STSG. In the long-term, NPWT can also improve scar surface regularity in the 
      hand, with an esthetic effect that is more satisfactory to clinicians and

TI  - Effects of recombinant human interleukin-10 on Treg cells, IL-10 and TGF-β in 
      transplantation of rabbit skin.
PG  - 639-44
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2013.1817 [doi]
AB  - The current study aimed to investigate the rejection and survival time of grafted 
      skin, and the changes of Treg cells, interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming 
      growth factor-β (TGF-β) in peripheral blood following skin transplantation with 
      recombinant human interleukin-10 (rhIL-10) or cyclosporin A (CsA), as well as the 
      role of IL-10 in immunological rejection mechanisms. A total of 36 rabbits were 
      divided into two groups. The skin of a donor rabbit was transplanted onto the 
      back of one receptor rabbit. Receptors were randomly divided into six groups, 
      including rhIL-10 low-dose (5 µg/kg/d), rhIL-10 high-dose (10 µg/kg/d), CsA 
      low-dose (5 mg/kg/d), CsA high-dose (10 mg/kg/d), rhIL-10 (5 µg/kg/d) and CsA (5 
      mg/kg/d) and negative control normal saline (NS; 1 ml/d). All groups received 
      intramuscular drug injection for ten days, beginning one day prior to skin 
      transplantation surgery. Following transplantation, each rabbit's peripheral 
      blood was collected at different times. The changes of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T 
      cells, IL-10 and TGF-β were determined by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. When compared with the control group, the rejection and 
      survival times of the experimental groups were longer following skin graft. 
      Compared with the two CsA groups and the control group, the proportion of 
      CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells of rhIL-10 groups was significantly upregulated on 
      the 4th and 7th days following surgery. However, TGF-β levels were not 
      significantly different. Data suggested that the concentration of IL-10 was 
      positively correlated with the proportion of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. In 
      addition, IL-10 may delay the rejection time of rabbit skin transplantation and 
      prolong the survival time. Thus, the role of IL-10 in inhibited allograft 
      rejection may be associated with CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells and IL-10, and may 
      be independent of TGF-β.

TI  - Immunoglobulin G promotes skin graft acceptance in an immunologically potent rat 
      model.
PG  - 39408-39420
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.9823 [doi]
AB  - Immunoglobulin G (IgG) has been shown to protect graft rejection after 
      transplantation, whereas the molecular mechanism of IgG in promoting graft 
      acceptance has not been well established. In this study, we tested the 
      effectiveness of IgG in preventing rejection of transplanted skin graft in an 
      immunologically potent rat model, and studied the mechanism of this protection. 
      We found that systemic or local administration of IgG significantly prolonged the 
      survival of skin grafts with the immune tolerance induced by IgG and subcutaneous 
      local injection of 1mg IgG to adult SD rat yielded the longest survival of skin 
      grafts from 5.8 to 17.3 days. We also found that IgG reduced the number of 
      pro-inflammatory cells especially lymphocytes, neutrophils and basophils, 
      increased the seral levels of anti-inflammatory factors including IL-10 and IL-4, 
      and activated CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, unveiling the mechanisms of 
      this protective effect. These findings provide new insight to support clinical 
      application of IgG in treating transplantation.

TI  - The composition of the microbiota modulates allograft rejection.
PG  - 2736-44
LID - 85295 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI85295 [doi]
AB  - Transplantation is the only cure for end-stage organ failure, but without 
      immunosuppression, T cells rapidly reject allografts. While genetic disparities 
      between donor and recipient are major determinants of the kinetics of transplant 
      rejection, little is known about the contribution of environmental factors. 
      Because colonized organs have worse transplant outcome than sterile organs, we 
      tested the influence of host and donor microbiota on skin transplant rejection. 
      Compared with untreated conventional mice, pretreatment of donors and recipients 
      with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx) or use of germ-free (GF) donors and 
      recipients resulted in prolonged survival of minor antigen-mismatched skin 
      grafts. Increased graft survival correlated with reduced type I IFN signaling in 
      antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and decreased priming of alloreactive T cells. 
      Colonization of GF mice with fecal material from untreated conventional mice, but 
      not from Abx-pretreated mice, enhanced the ability of APCs to prime alloreactive 
      T cells and accelerated graft rejection, suggesting that alloimmunity is 
      modulated by the composition of microbiota rather than the quantity of bacteria. 
      Abx pretreatment of conventional mice also delayed rejection of major 
      antigen-mismatched skin and MHC class II-mismatched cardiac allografts. This 
      study demonstrates that Abx pretreatment prolongs graft survival, suggesting that 
      targeting microbial constituents is a potential therapeutic strategy for 
      enhancing graft acceptance.

TI  - EASEPort NPWT System to Enhance Skin Graft Survival--A Simple Assembly.
PG  - 518-23
LID - 10.9738/INTSURG-D-14-00029.1 [doi]
AB  - Skin graft has been known to be prone to failure. This study was aimed to make a 
      simplification of the negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), which follows 
      EASEPort (effective, affordable, safe, easily handled, and portable) concept to 
      support the take of skin graft. The design of the EASEPort-NPWT was then made and 
      technically verified. Thereafter, an animal experimental study comparing the 
      EASEPort-NPWT to the classic tie-over technique on skin graft over exudative 
      wound was conducted. The EASEPort-NPWT was verified to be able to yield and 
      sustain the subatmospheric pressure needed. In the animal study, the treatment 
      group showed better skin graft survival rate (97.55 ± 11.18% take) than the 
      control group (54.88 ± 19.73%) on day-7. Histopathology examination showed good 
      quality of the skin structures taken from the treatment group, which was better 
      than the structures of the skin in the control group. In summary, this study has 
      been able to fulfill its objective to create a device following EASEPort concept. 
      Subsequently, the EASEPort-NPWT was able to enhance skin graft survival rate in 
      exudative wound.

AB  - Transplant recipients face an increased risk of cancer compared with the healthy 
      population. Although several studies have examined the direct effects of 
      immunosuppressive drugs on cancer cells, little is known about the interactions 
      between pharmacological immunosuppression and cancer immunosurveillance. We 
      investigated the different effects of rapamycin (Rapa) versus cyclosporine A 
      (CsA) on tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells. After adoptive transfer of CD8(+) T cell 
      receptor-transgenic OTI T cells, recipient mice received either skin grafts 
      expressing ovalbumin (OVA) or OVA-expressing B16F10 melanoma cells. Animals were 
      treated daily with Rapa or CsA. Skin graft rejection and tumor growth as well as 
      molecular and cellular analyses of skin- and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were 
      performed. Both Rapa and CsA were equally efficient in prolonging skin graft 
      survival when applied at clinically relevant doses. In contrast to Rapa-treated 
      animals, CsA led to accelerated tumor growth in the presence of adoptively 
      transferred tumor-reactive CD8(+) OTI T cells. Further analyses showed that T-bet 
      was downregulated by CsA (but not Rapa) in CD8(+) T cells and that cancer 
      cytotoxicity was profoundly inhibited in the absence of T-bet. CsA reduces 
      T-bet-dependent cancer immunosurveillance by CD8(+) T cells. This may contribute 
      to the increased cancer risk in transplant recipients receiving calcineurin 
      inhibitors.

AB  - Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) represents a major cause of allograft 
      dysfunction and results in allograft failure in solid organ transplantation. 
      Cyclic helix B peptide (CHBP) is a novel erythropoietin-derived peptide that 
      ameliorated renal allograft rejection in a renal transplantation model. However, 
      its effect on AMR remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of 
      CHBP on AMR using a secondary allogeneic skin transplantation model, which was 
      created by transplanting skin from BALB/c mice to C57BL/6 mice with or without 
      CHBP treatment. A secondary syngeneic skin transplantation model, involving 
      transplantation from C57BL/6 mice to C57BL/6 mice, was also created to act as a 
      control. Skin graft rejection, CD19(+) B cell infiltration in the skin allograft, 
      the percentages of splenic plasma cells, germinal center (GC) B cells, and Tfh 
      cells, the serum levels of donor specific antibodies (DSAs), and NF-κB signaling 
      in splenocytes were analyzed. Skin allograft survival was significantly prolonged 
      in the CHBP group compared to the allogeneic group. CHBP treatment also 
      significantly reduced the CD19(+) B cell infiltration in the skin allograft, 
      decreased the percentages of splenic plasma cells, GC B cells, and Tfh cells, and 
      ameliorated the increase in the serum DSA level. At a molecular level, CHBP 
      downregulated P100, RelB, and P52 in splenocytes. CHBP prolonged skin allograft 
      survival by inhibiting AMR, which may be mediated by inhibition of NF-κB 
      signaling to suppress B cell immune responses, thereby decreasing the DSA level.

TI  - Netrin-1 prolongs skin graft survival by inducing the transformation of 
      mesenchymal stem cells from pro-rejection to immune-tolerant phenotype.
PG  - 8741-8750
LID - 19268 [pii]
LID - 10.26355/eurrev_201910_19268 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) induce allograft immune tolerance, but 
      low efficacy severely limits their wide application. In this work, Netrin-1 was 
      used to maintain MSC function in an IR environment to study its role in the 
      immune tolerance induction of the allograft. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      experiments were divided into three groups: the control group, the IR group and 
      the Netrin-1 group (Netrin-1 was added to MSC medium and then cultured for 48 h). 
      After digestion, MSCs were mixed with TLR4 and TLR3 antibodies (BD), incubated 
      for 20 min, and washed with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) three times. The mean 
      fluorescence intensity (MFI) of TLR4 and TLR3 was detected by flow cytometry. 
      Isolated lymphocytes were divided into four groups: the control group (no 
      treatment), the MSC group (lymphocytes were co-cultured with MSCs in the control 
      group), the rejection group (lymphocytes were co-cultured with MSCs in the IR 
      group), and the Netrin-1 group (MSCs in the IR group) was stimulated by Netrin-1 
      for 48h. RESULTS: Our study found that compared with control mice, toll-like 
      receptor (TLR3) expression in bone marrow MSCs decreased as the expression of 
      TLR4 increased, the secretion of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and 
      interleukin-10 (IL-10) was reduced, while the secretion of IL-6 significantly 
      increased in immune rejection (IR) mice. MSCs in IR mice promoted T-cell 
      proliferation and reduced the ratio of Treg cells. Netrin-1 inhibited the 
      pro-rejection effect of these MSCs, further inhibited T-cell proliferation and 
      facilitated an increase in the ratio of Treg cells. The animal experiment results 
      showed that MSC transplantation in the rejection group would shorten the mean 
      survival time of the skin graft and induce the infiltration of lymphocytes. 
      Netrin-1 prolonged the mean survival time of the skin graft by enhancing MSC 
      function. The immunohistochemistry results showed that, compared with the 
      rejection group, the T cell number in the skin graft significantly decreased in 
      the Netrin-1 group. CONCLUSIONS: MSC can be divided into immune-tolerant and 
      pro-rejection types in organ transplantation and Netrin-1 can induce the 
      transformation of MSC from the pro-rejection to immune-tolerant type and markedly 
      prolong the skin graft survival time.

TI  - Altered glycosylation in donor mice causes rejection of strain-matched skin and 
      heart grafts.
PG  - 797-805
LID - 10.1111/ajt.12634 [doi]
AB  - Differential protein glycosylation in the donor and recipient can have profound 
      consequences for transplanted organs, as evident in ABO-incompatible 
      transplantation and xenotransplantation. In this study, we investigated the 
      impact of altered fucosylation on graft acceptance by using donor mice 
      overexpressing human α1,2-fucosyltransferase (HTF). Skin and heart grafts from 
      HTF transgenic mice were rapidly rejected by otherwise completely matched 
      recipients (median survival times 16 and 14 days, respectively). HTF skin 
      transplanted onto mice lacking T and B cells induced an natural killer 
      cell-mediated innate rejection crisis that affected 50-95% of the graft at 10-20 
      days. However, in the absence of adaptive immunity, the residual graft recovered 
      and survived long-term (>100 days). Experiments using "parked" grafts or MHC 
      class II-deficient recipients suggested that indirect rather than direct antigen 
      presentation plays a role in HTF skin graft rejection, although the putative 
      antigen(s) was not identified. We conclude that altered glycosylation patterns on 
      donor tissue can trigger a powerful rejection response comprising both innate and 
      adaptive components. This has potential implications for allotransplantation, in 
      light of increasing recognition of the variability of the human glycome, and for 
      xenotransplantation, where carbohydrate remodeling has been a lynchpin of donor 
      genetic modification.

LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.176381 [doi]
AB  - Alloreactive memory, unlike naive, CD8+ T cells resist transplantation tolerance 
      protocols and are a critical barrier to long-term graft acceptance in the clinic. 
      We here show that semiallogeneic pregnancy successfully reprogrammed memory 
      fetus/graft-specific CD8+ T cells (TFGS) toward hypofunction. Female C57BL/6 mice 
      harboring memory CD8+ T cells generated by the rejection of BALB/c skin grafts 
      and then mated with BALB/c males achieved rates of pregnancy comparable with 
      naive controls. Postpartum CD8+ TFGS from skin-sensitized dams upregulated 
      expression of T cell exhaustion (TEX) markers (Tox, Eomes, PD-1, TIGIT, and 
      Lag3). Transcriptional analysis corroborated an enrichment of canonical TEX genes 
      in postpartum memory TFGS and revealed a downregulation of a subset of 
      memory-associated transcripts. Strikingly, pregnancy induced extensive epigenetic 
      modifications of exhaustion- and memory-associated genes in memory TFGS, whereas 
      minimal epigenetic modifications were observed in naive TFGS. Finally, postpartum 
      memory TFGS durably expressed the exhaustion-enriched phenotype, and their 
      susceptibility to transplantation tolerance was significantly restored compared 
      with memory TFGS. These findings advance the concept of pregnancy as an 
      epigenetic modulator inducing hypofunction in memory CD8+ T cells that has 
      relevance not only for pregnancy and transplantation tolerance, but also for 
      tumor immunity and chronic infections.

AB  - Adenosine is widely known as a potent modulator of innate and acquired immunity. 
      It is released during transplants, and acts on four subtype receptors. In 
      previous studies, we demonstrated that pharmacological preconditioning (PPC), 
      pre-administration of the selective A(1) receptor (A(1)R) agonist led to A(1)R 
      desensitization, is followed by upregulation of the adenosine A(2A) receptor. 
      This immunosuppressive effect resulted in lymphopenia, and it reduced T-cell 
      reactivity. The aim of the current study was to challenge the immunosuppressive 
      effects of A(1)R-PPC in models of allogeneic grafts. PPC mice were treated by 
      intraperitoneal injection using specific adenosine A(1)R agonist 24 h and 12 h 
      before starting any procedure. We challenged our method in novel allogeneic 
      muscle and skin grafts models. Mice and grafts were assessed by complete blood 
      counts, MLR from PPC splenocytes, and pathological evaluation. We found a 
      significant reduction in WBC and lymphocyte counts in PPC-treated mice. Two-way 
      MLR with splenocytes from PPC grafted mice showed decreased proliferation and 
      anergy. Histology of PPC allogeneic grafts revealed profoundly less infiltration 
      and even less muscle necrosis compared to vehicle treated allografts. Similar 
      results observed in PPC skin transplantation. To conclude, PPC moderated graft 
      rejection in separate allogeneic challenges, and reduced lymphocytes infiltration 
      and ischemic damage.

AB  - Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K) γ and δ are preferentially enriched in 
      leukocytes, and defects in these signaling pathways have been shown to impair T 
      cell activation. The effects of PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ on alloimmunity remain 
      underexplored. Here, we show that both PI3Kγ (-/-) and PI3Kδ (D910A/D910A) mice 
      receiving heart allografts have suppression of alloreactive T effector cells and 
      delayed acute rejection. However, PI3Kδ mutation also dampens regulatory T cells 
      (Treg). After treatment with low dose CTLA4-Ig, PI3Kγ (-/-) , but not PI3Κδ 
      (D910A/D910A) , recipients exhibit indefinite prolongation of heart allograft 
      survival. PI3Kδ (D910A/D910A) Tregs have increased apoptosis and impaired 
      survival. Selective inhibition of PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ (using PI3Kδ and dual PI3Kγδ 
      chemical inhibitors) shows that PI3Kγ inhibition compensates for the negative 
      effect of PI3Kδ inhibition on long-term allograft survival. These data serve as a 
      basis for future PI3K-based immune therapies for 
      transplantation.Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K) γ and δ are key regulators 
      of T cell signaling. Here the author show, using mouse heart allograft 
      transplantation models, that PI3Kγ or PI3Kδ deficiency prolongs graft survival, 
      but selective inhibition of PI3Kγ or PI3Kδ reveals alternative transplant 
      survival outcomes post CTLA4-Ig treatment.

TI  - Evaluating full-thickness skin grafts in intraperitoneal onlay mesh position

AB  - BACKGROUND: Importance: Hernia surgery requires reinforcement material with few 
      side effects when used in the intraperitoneal position. Autologous skin grafting 
      may meet this requirement, but animal experiments are obligatory before being 
      applied in humans. OBJECTIVE: To compare survival and effects of isogeneic 
      full-thickness skin grafts in the intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) position in 
      mice, with a control group using the onlay position. Primary end point was graft 
      survival and secondary end point adhesion formation and inflammation through 
      NF-κB activity. METHODS: Design: Intervention study with 8-week follow-up in 
      accordance with ARRIVE criteria, performed between 2015 and 2016. SETTING: Animal 
      laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Transgenic C57BL/6 mice with isogeneic background were 
      used. Recipients were female wild-type phenotype mice >3 mo (n = 24). Donors were 
      male or female mice >7 mo, with phenotype-positive for the luciferase gene 
      (n = 20) or positive for NF-κB-luciferase gene (n = 4). INTERVENTION: 
      Full-thickness skin was grafted in the IPOM position and compared with grafts in 
      the onlay position as controls. Survival was evaluated by regular longitudinal 
      postoperative luminescence imaging over 8 wk. Adherence formation was evaluated 
      macroscopically after sacrifice. Inflammation of full-thickness skin grafts in 
      IPOM position of NF-κB mice was evaluated in four additional mice. Main outcome 
      and measure: Survival of grafts, evaluated by luminescence. RESULTS: Ten animals 
      received grafts in the IPOM position, and 10 in the onlay position as controls. 
      Graft survival after 8 wk was 100% (20/20). Average luminescence at the end of 
      the 8-week period was 999,597 flux (min 162,800, max 2,521,530) in the IPOM group 
      (n = 10) and 769,708 flux (min 76,590, max 2,164,080) in the onlay control group 
      (n = 10). No adhesions requiring sharp dissection (Jenkins' scale >2) were seen. 
      Four animals with grafts in the IPOM position showed peak inflammation (NF-κB 
      activity) 5 d after surgery subsiding toward the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Full-thickness skin survives as well in the IPOM position as in the onlay control 
      position, and few adherences develop. Further studies are required to fully 
      characterize the tissue remodeling and repair processes associated with IPOM skin 
      grafting. The result is relevant in the search for alternative reinforcement 
      materials to be used in complex hernia surgery in humans.

AB  - Cadaveric skin allograft is the current standard of treatment for temporary 
      coverage of large burn wounds. Porcine xenografts are viable alternatives but 
      undergo α-1,3-galactose (Gal)-mediated hyperacute rejection and are lost by 
      post-operative day (POD) 3 because of naturally occurring antibodies to Gal in 
      primate recipients. Using baboons, we previously demonstrated that xenografts 
      from GalT-KO swine (lacking Gal) provided wound coverage comparable with 
      allografts with systemic immunosuppression. In this study, we investigate topical 
      immunosuppression as an alternative to prolong xenograft survival. Full-thickness 
      wounds in baboons were created and covered with xenogeneic and allogeneic 
      split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs). Animals were treated with slow-release 
      (TyroSphere-encapsulated) topical formulations (cyclosporine-A [CSA] or 
      Tacrolimus) applied 1) directly to the STSGs only, or 2) additionally to the 
      wound bed before STSG and 1). Topical CSA did not improve either xenograft or 
      allograft survival (median: treated grafts = 12.5 days, control = 14 days; P = 
      0.27) with similar results when topical Tacrolimus was used. Pretreatment of 
      wound beds resulted in a significant reduction of xenograft survival compared 
      with controls (10 vs 14 days; P = 0.0002), with comparable results observed in 
      allografts. This observation was associated with marked reduction of inflammation 
      on histology with Tacrolimus and not CSA. Prolongation of allograft and xenograft 
      survival after application to full-thickness wound beds was not achieved with the 
      current formulation of topical immunosuppressants. Modulation of inflammation 
      within the wound bed was effective with Tacrolimus pretreatment before STSG 
      application and may serve as a treatment strategy in related fields.

TI  - Targeting JAK2 reduces GVHD and xenograft rejection through regulation of T cell 
      differentiation.
PG  - 1582-1587
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1712452115 [doi]
AB  - Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) signal transduction is a critical mediator of the immune 
      response. JAK2 is implicated in the onset of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), 
      which is a significant cause of transplant-related mortality after allogeneic 
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Transfer of JAK2(-/-) donor T 
      cells to allogeneic recipients leads to attenuated GVHD yet maintains 
      graft-versus-leukemia. Th1 differentiation among JAK2(-/-) T cells is 
      significantly decreased compared with wild-type controls. Conversely, iTreg and 
      Th2 polarization is significantly increased among JAK2(-/-) T cells. Pacritinib 
      is a multikinase inhibitor with potent activity against JAK2. Pacritinib 
      significantly reduces GVHD and xenogeneic skin graft rejection in distinct rodent 
      models and maintains donor antitumor immunity. Moreover, pacritinib spares iTregs 
      and polarizes Th2 responses as observed among JAK2(-/-) T cells. Collectively, 
      these data clearly identify JAK2 as a therapeutic target to control donor 
      alloreactivity and promote iTreg responses after allo-HCT or solid organ 
      transplantation. As such, a phase I/II acute GVHD prevention trial combining 
      pacritinib with standard immune suppression after allo-HCT is actively being 
      investigated (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02891603).

TI  - Immunomodulatory Strategies Directed Toward Tolerance of Vascularized Composite 
      Allografts.
PG  - 1590-1597
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000000681 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Achieving tolerance of vascularized composite allografts (VCAs) would 
      improve the risk-to-benefit ratio in patients who undergo this life-enhancing, 
      though not lifesaving, transplant. Kidney cotransplantation along with a short 
      course of high-dose immunosuppression enables tolerance of heart allografts 
      across a full major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatch. In this study, we 
      investigated whether tolerance of VCAs across full MHC disparities could be 
      achieved in animals already tolerant of heart and kidney allografts. METHODS: 
      Miniature swine that were tolerant of heart and/or kidney allografts long term 
      underwent transplantation of myocutaneous VCA across the same MHC barrier. Before 
      VCA transplant, group 1 (n = 3) underwent class I-mismatched kidney 
      transplantation; group 2 (n = 3) underwent 2 sequential class I-mismatched kidney 
      transplantations; group 3 (n = 2) underwent haploidentical MHC-mismatched 
      heart/kidney transplantation; and group 4 (n = 2) underwent full MHC-mismatched 
      heart/kidney transplantation. RESULTS: All 3 animals in group 1 and 2 of 3 
      animals in group 2 showed skin rejection within 85 days; 1 animal in group 2 
      showed prolonged skin survival longer than 200 days. Animals in groups 3 and 4 
      showed skin rejection within 30 days and regained in vitro evidence of donor 
      responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first preclinical study in which hearts, 
      kidneys, and VCAs have been transplanted into the same recipient. Despite VCA 
      rejection, tolerance of heart and kidney allografts was maintained. These results 
      suggest that regulatory tolerance of skin is possible but not generally achieved 
      by the same level of immunomodulation that is capable of inducing tolerance of 
      heart and kidney allografts. Achieving tolerance of skin may require additional 
      immunomodulatory therapies.

TI  - Effect of Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma Gel on Skin Flap Survival.
PG  - 1611-1620
LID - 10.12659/MSM.913115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Skin flap grafting is one of the most common tissue transplantations 
      for wound repair and organ reconstruction. Thus, improving the survival rate of 
      the transplanted skin flap is important. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an 
      autologous platelet concentrate obtained from whole blood. It has been widely 
      used in repairing tissue defects. Considering that the PRP gel has similar 
      biological characteristics, this study used PRP gel for skin flap 
      transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS PRP gel from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was 
      prepared and the growth factor concentration was determined. A rat skin flap 
      model was established to evaluate the survival rate of skin flap. Morphologic 
      evaluation was also done. RESULTS We found that the PRP gel increased the 
      survival rate of the skin flap. In addition, it reduces the inflammation response 
      in skin flap transplantation and has better effects in terms of generating new 
      soft tissue. CONCLUSIONS The effectiveness PRP gel in skin flap transplantation 
      is satisfactory. The possible mechanisms by which PRP gel promotes the survival 
      of the skin flap includes platelets, growth factors, immune activity factor, and 
      fibrin. PRP could be a new clinical method for promoting skin flap survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Donor-specific antibodies of the IgG isotype are measured routinely 
      for diagnostic purposes in renal transplant recipients and are associated with 
      antibody-mediated rejection and long-term graft loss. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed 
      to investigate whether MHC-specific antibodies of the IgE isotype are induced 
      during allograft rejection. METHODS: Anti-MHC/HLA IgE levels were measured in 
      sera of mice grafted with skin or heart transplants from various donor strains 
      and in sera of kidney transplant patients with high levels of HLA IgG. Mediator 
      release was triggered in vitro by stimulating basophils that were coated with 
      murine or human IgE-positive serum, respectively, with specific recombinant 
      MHC/HLA antigens. Kidney tissue samples obtained from organ donors were analyzed 
      by using flow cytometry for cells expressing the high-affinity receptor for IgE 
      (FcεRI). RESULTS: Donor MHC class I- and MHC class II-specific IgE was found on 
      acute rejection of skin and heart grafts in several murine strain combinations, 
      as well as during chronic antibody-mediated heart graft rejection. Anti-HLA IgE, 
      including donor HLA class I and II specificities, was identified in a group of 
      sensitized transplant recipients. Murine and human anti-MHC/HLA IgE triggered 
      mediator release in coated basophils on stimulation with specific MHC/HLA 
      antigens. HLA-specific IgE was not linked to atopy, and allergen-specific IgE 
      present in allergic patients did not cross-react with HLA antigens. FcεRI(+) 
      cells were found in the human renal cortex and medulla and provide targets for 
      HLA-specific IgE. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that MHC/HLA-specific IgE 
      develops during an alloresponse and is functional in mediating effector 
      mechanisms.

AB  - A 65-year-old man had extensive burns of the lower legs in 1991, at the age of 40 
      years. He was treated by nonvascularized and de-epithelialized, allogeneic 
      split-thickness skin allograft and cyclosporine monotherapy for 2 months. Ulcers 
      developed between 10 and 25 years after transplantation and a surgical 
      debridement on the lower extremities was required. Analyses of the removed tissue 
      allografts showed chronic antibody-mediated and cellular rejection with extensive 
      and dense fibrosis, and diffuse capillary C4d deposits. An anti-DRB1*08:01, 
      donor-specific antibody was present. A unique clinical condition with late 
      immunopathological features of human skin chronic allograft rejection is 
      reported.

TI  - Transplantation of tail skin to study allogeneic CD4 T cell responses in mice.
PG  - e51724
LID - 10.3791/51724 [doi]
LID - 51724
AB  - The study of T cell responses and their consequences during allo-antigen 
      recognition requires a model that enables one to distinguish between donor and 
      host T cells, to easily monitor the graft, and to adapt the system in order to 
      answer different immunological questions. Medawar and colleagues established 
      allogeneic tail-skin transplantation in mice in 1955. Since then, the skin 
      transplantation model has been continuously modified and adapted to answer 
      specific questions. The use of tail-skin renders this model easy to score for 
      graft rejection, requires neither extensive preparation nor deep anesthesia, is 
      applicable to animals of all genetic background, discourages ischemic necrosis, 
      and permits chemical and biological intervention. In general, both CD4(+) and 
      CD8(+) allogeneic T cells are responsible for the rejection of allografts since 
      they recognize mismatched major histocompatibility antigens from different mouse 
      strains. Several models have been described for activating allogeneic T cells in 
      skin-transplanted mice. The identification of major histocompatibility complex 
      (MHC) class I and II molecules in different mouse strains including C57BL/6 mice 
      was an important step toward understanding and studying T cell-mediated 
      alloresponses. In the tail-skin transplantation model described here, a 
      three-point mutation (I-A(bm12)) in the antigen-presenting groove of the 
      MHC-class II (I-A(b)) molecule is sufficient to induce strong allogeneic CD4(+) T 
      cell activation in C57BL/6 mice. Skin grafts from I-A(bm12) mice on C57BL/6 mice 
      are rejected within 12-15 days, while syngeneic grafts are accepted for up to 100 
      days. The absence of T cells (CD3(-/-) and Rag2(-/-) mice) allows skin graft 
      acceptance up to 100 days, which can be overcome by transferring 2 x 10(4) wild 
      type or transgenic T cells. Adoptively transferred T cells proliferate and 
      produce IFN-γ in I-A(bm12)-transplanted Rag2(-/-) mice.

TI  - Effects of different scar types on flap viability in a skin flap model: an 
      experimental study.
PG  - 1389-1399
LID - 10.55730/1300-0144.5446 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of tissues with 
      multiple traumas, scarred pedicles, and medial scarring as a flap. METHODS: 
      Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into four equal groups. The modified 
      McFarlane flap was chosen as the flap model. In Group 1 (control), a dorsal skin 
      flap was elevated and then sutured back into original position. In the other 
      groups, a two-phase procedure was used. In Group 2 (pedicle incision), scar 
      tissue was created with a skin incision at the prospective pedicle site of the 
      flap and then sutured to its original site. In Group 3 (preconditioning), 
      multiple full-thickness traumas were performed along the entire flap body, and in 
      Group 4 (middle incision) scar tissue was created with a skin incision at the 
      prospective middle region of the flap. Then, after 45 days, dorsal flaps were 
      raised in all rats and then sutured back into position. Seven days later, flap 
      survival was evaluated through microangiography and histological evaluation of 
      flap segments. Histopathological examination included assessment of the number of 
      vessels, necrosis, infiltration with polymorphonuclear leukocytes, edema, 
      fibrosis, inflammation, increase in fibroblast activity, and neovascularization. 
      RESULTS: The flap survival rates were 66.78% in Group 1, 68.05% in Group 2, 68.5% 
      in Group 3, and 60.01% in Group 4. The flap survival rate was significantly lower 
      in Group 4 (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in flap survival 
      between Groups 1, 2, and 3. On microangiographic examination, the vascular 
      network extended more distally and was densest around the scar line in Group 2. 
      Vascularization was poorest in Group 4. On histological examination, the number 
      of vessels tended to be greatest in Groups 3 and 4 but this was not significantly 
      different between groups (p &lt; 0.05). DISCUSSION: The study findings showed 
      that it may be possible to raise a flap from a previously mutilated site 
      secondary to scar formation and multiple full-thickness traumas along the flap 
      body. However, distal necrosis may occur in situations when the scar is 
      positioned in the middle region of the prospective flap.

TI  - Different Effects of Tacrolimus on Innate and Adaptive Immune Cells in the 
      Allograft Transplantation.

AB  - While tacrolimus (FK506) is currently used as immunosuppression therapy in 
      transplant recipient, the immunological mechanism remains unknown. Herein, the 
      immunoregulatory effects of FK506 were investigated in the physiological status 
      and allogeneic skin transplantation. FK506 cannot significantly alter the 
      functions of innate immune cells (macrophages and neutrophils) and adaptive 
      immune cells (T cells) in the physiological status. However, it can effectively 
      delay allogeneic skin-graft rejection through ameliorating the T cell responses, 
      but not myeloid-derived innate immune cell responses. Importantly, it did not 
      affect the allograft recipient macrophage innate immune defence capacity to 
      bacteria. In clinics, FK506 treatment can significantly control the cytokine 
      production in T cells, but not non-T cells. This study shows targeting 
      calcineurin signalling, FK506, to be essential in inducing allograft tolerance, 
      but not to damage the innate defence capacity, validating the immune cell 
      phenotypes as a potential marker in transplantation following FK506 treatment.

AB  - A primary goal in the management of burn wounds is early wound closure. The use 
      of skin allografts represents a lifesaving strategy for severe burn patients, but 
      their ultimate rejection limits their potential efficacy and utility. IL-6 is a 
      major pleiotropic cytokine which critically links innate and adaptive immune 
      responses. Here, we devised anti-IL-6 receptor eluting gelatin methacryloyl 
      (GelMA) biomaterials (GelMA/anti-IL-6), which were implanted at the interface 
      between the wound beds and skin allografts. Our visible light crosslinked 
      GelMA/anti-IL-6 immunomodulatory biomaterial (IMB) demonstrated a stable kinetic 
      release profile of anti-IL-6. In addition, the incorporation of anti-IL-6 within 
      the GelMA hydrogel had no effect on the mechanical properties of the hydrogels. 
      Using a highly stringent skin transplant model, the GelMA/anti-IL-6 IMB almost 
      doubled the survival of skin allografts. The use of GelMA/anti-IL-6 IMB was far 
      superior to systemic anti-IL-6 receptor treatment in prolonging skin allograft 
      survival. As compared to the untreated control group, skin from the 
      GelMA/anti-IL-6 IMB group contained significantly fewer alloreactive T cells and 
      macrophages. Interestingly, the environmental milieu of the draining lymph nodes 
      (DLNs) of the mice implanted with the GelMA/anti-IL-6 IMB was also considerably 
      less pro-inflammatory. The percentage of CD4(+) IFNγ(+) cells was much lower in 
      the DLNs of the GelMA/anti-IL-6 IMB group in comparison to the GelMA group. These 
      data highlight the importance of localized immune delivery in prolonging skin 
      allograft survival and its potential utility in treating patients with severe 
      burns.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin flap transplantation is a common wound repair method in 
      orthopedic surgery, but skin flap necrosis remains problematic. Memantine, an 
      excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist, is currently used in the treatment of 
      moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, due to its ability to promote 
      angiogenesis and reduce oxidative stress. This study investigated the effect of 
      memantine on the survival of random skin flaps in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty six male SD rats were divided into control, 
      high-dose (20 mg/kg per day), and low-dose (10 mg/kg per day) groups and 
      underwent a McFarland flap procedure. Seven days later, the survival of the flap 
      was evaluated, The microvascular density and neutrophil density were measured by 
      hematoxylin and eosin staining. Lead angiography was used to detect angiogenesis, 
      and laser Doppler was used to detect blood perfusion. Expression levels of 
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor 
      necrosis factor (TNF)-α, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, nuclear factor kappa 
      B(NF-κB) and Mitogen-activated protein kinase（MAPK）were detected by 
      immunohistochemistry. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring the levels of 
      malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). RESULTS: Compared with the 
      control group, the flap survival area of memantine group, especially the 
      high-dose group, was larger, VEGF expression, microvascular density, 
      angiogenesis, blood perfusion, and superoxide dismutase in the flap were higher 
      in the Memantine-H group than in the Memantine-L and control groups (P < 0.01). 
      In addition, levels of neutrophil density, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, TLR4, NF-κB, MAPK 
      and malondialdehyde decreased significantly in the Memantine-H group (P < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Memantine can promote the survival of skin flap in rats by improving 
      the blood supply, promoting angiogenesis, inhibiting the inflammatory response, 
      and reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury.

TI  - A Comparative Examination of the Clinical Outcome and Histological Appearance of 
      Cryopreserved and Fresh Split-Thickness Skin Grafts.

AB  - The clinical use of frozen, human allogeneic skin grafts is considered a suitable 
      alternative to freshly harvested allogeneic skin grafts when the latter are not 
      available. However, limited functional and histological information exists 
      regarding the effects of cryopreservation on allogeneic skin grafts, especially 
      those across mismatched histocompatibility barriers. Thus, we performed a 
      side-by-side comparative study of fresh vs frozen skin grafts, across both minor 
      and major histocompatibility barriers, in a miniature swine model. Since porcine 
      skin shares many physical and immunological properties with human skin, our 
      findings have relevance to current clinical practices involving allogeneic 
      grafting and may support future, temporary wound therapies involving frozen 
      xenografts, comprised genetically modified porcine skin. Four miniature swine 
      underwent harvest and grafting of split-thickness skin, with and without 
      cryopreservation, in order to observe autologous grafts and grafts across minor 
      and major histocompatibility barriers. A biopsy of the grafts was done at regular 
      intervals for study of architecture, vascularization, and outcomes. All grafts 
      vascularized without technical complications. Differences were noted in the early 
      appearance of some fresh vs frozen grafts, but no significant difference was 
      observed in overall survival times in any of the experimental groups. These 
      results demonstrate that despite early observable differences in the healing 
      process, cryopreservation and thawing does not significantly affect long-term 
      graft survival or time to rejection, thus supporting the clinical and 
      experimental use of fresh and frozen split-thickness skin grafts as comparable 
      and interchangeable.

TI  - Comparing the Curative Efficacy of Different Skin Grafting Methods for 
      Third-Degree Burn Wounds.
PG  - 2668-2673
AB  - BACKGROUND Our research purpose was to compare the curative efficacy of different 
      skin grafting methods for treating third-degree burn wounds. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
      A total of 105 patients with third-degree burns were involved in this study. The 
      burn wounds of these patients were treated using three different methods: Meek 
      skin grafting, Stamp skin grafting, and Microskin grafting. Patients treated with 
      different methods were placed in different groups. The skin graft survival rate, 
      skin graft fusion time, wound healing time, total time of surgery, and 1% total 
      body surface area (TBSA) treatment costs in each group were evaluated during and 
      after the grafting procedures. After the operations, patients were followed up 
      for 3 to 18 months in order to evaluate the postoperative outcomes. RESULTS The 
      skin graft survival rate was significantly higher in the Meek group compared to 
      the rates in the Stamp and Microskin groups (both P<0.01). In addition, the skin 
      graft fusion time, wound healing time, and 1% TBSA treatment costs were 
      significantly lower in the Meek group compared to those in the Stamp and 
      Microskin groups (both P<0.01). Furthermore, the Meek group exhibited better 
      results with respect to curative efficacy, scarring status, and joint activity in 
      comparison to the other two groups (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The Meek skin 
      grafting method showed better clinical efficacy for treating large wound areas in 
      third-degree burn patients compared to the Stamp and Microskin skin grafting 
      methods.

TI  - Δ⁹-Tetrahydrocannabinol attenuates allogeneic host-versus-graft response and 
      delays skin graft rejection through activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 and 
      induction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells.
PG  - 435-47
LID - 10.1189/jlb.3A0115-030RR [doi]
AB  - Immune cells have been shown to express cannabinoid receptors and to produce 
      endogenous ligands. Moreover, activation of cannabinoid receptors on immune cells 
      has been shown to trigger potent immunosuppression. Despite such studies, the 
      role of cannabinoids in transplantation, specifically to prevent allograft 
      rejection, has not, to our knowledge, been investigated previously. In the 
      current study, we tested the effect of THC on the suppression of HvGD as well as 
      rejection of skin allografts. To this end, we studied HvGD by injecting H-2(k) 
      splenocytes into H-2(b) mice and analyzing the immune response in the draining 
      ingLNs. THC treatment significantly reduced T cell proliferation and activation 
      in draining LNs of the recipient mice and decreased early stage 
      rejection-indicator cytokines, including IL-2 and IFN-γ. THC treatment also 
      increased the allogeneic skin graft survival. THC treatment in HvGD mice led to 
      induction of MDSCs. Using MDSC depletion studies as well as adoptive transfer 
      experiments, we found that THC-induced MDSCs were necessary for attenuation of 
      HvGD. Additionally, using pharmacological inhibitors of CB1 and CB2 receptors and 
      CB1 and CB2 knockout mice, we found that THC was working preferentially through 
      CB1. Together, our research shows, for the first time to our knowledge, that 
      targeting cannabinoid receptors may provide a novel treatment modality to 
      attenuate HvGD and prevent allograft rejection.

AB  - Previous studies indicated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit 
      immunomodulatory properties in composite tissue allotransplantation. However, due 
      to the high immunogenicity of skin, although the single administration of MSCs 
      improves survival of the skin allotransplant, immune rejection is still 
      inevitable. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether multiple administrations 
      of MSCs would improve immune tolerance in the allogeneic skin graft, compared to 
      that with a single administration in a mouse model. After full-thickness skin 
      allotransplantation on the backs of the mice, the recipient mice were infused 
      with phosphate-buffered saline and isogenic 1.5 × 10(5)/mL adipose-derived stem 
      cells (ADSCs). ADSCs were transplanted into different mice according to the 
      different injection frequencies such as single, once a week, and twice a week. 
      Skin sections were taken on days 7 and 21 post-transplantation in all groups for 
      gene expression and histological studies. ADSCs increased skin allograft survival 
      compared to that in control mice (P < 0.05). Interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis 
      factor-alpha messenger RNA levels were decreased, and the abundance of 
      lymphocytes, based on immunohistochemistry, was also decreased in ADSC-infused 
      mice (P < 0.05). However, among the different ADSC injection frequency groups, 
      multiple ADSC infusion did not improve the survival rate and decreased 
      proinflammatory cytokines and lymphocytes, compared to those with the single 
      administration of ADSCs (P > 0.05). Conversely, the results with single 
      administration were slightly better than those with multiple administrations. Our 
      study demonstrated that ADSCs have the potential for immunomodulation in vivo. 
      However, the results with multiple ADSC administration were not as good as those 
      with single administration, which indicates the complexity of ADSCs in vivo and 
      implying the need for adequate preclinical experimentation.

TI  - Association of Smoking and Other Factors With the Outcome of Mohs Reconstruction 
      Using Flaps or Grafts.
PG  - 407-413
LID - 10.1001/jamafacial.2019.0243 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Smoking, a common lifestyle trait, is considered by many surgeons to 
      be a major risk factor for postoperative complications. However, in the 
      literature on local reconstruction, the association between smoking and the rate 
      of postoperative complications after cutaneous tissue transfer is not well 
      characterized. OBJECTIVE: To study the outcomes of flaps and grafts used in Mohs 
      micrographic surgery reconstruction with respect to smoking status and 
      patient-specific and surgery-specific variables. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective case-control study was conducted at a single 
      tertiary referral center among 1008 patients who underwent Mohs reconstruction 
      repaired by flap or graft between July 1, 2012, and June 30, 2016, and were 
      selected via consecutive sampling. Cases with incomplete records or those in 
      which a single flap or graft was used to repair multiple defects were excluded. 
      Data analysis was performed from September 2017 to January 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: Postoperative acute and long-term complications. Acute 
      complications included postsurgical infection, dehiscence, hematoma, uncontrolled 
      bleeding, and tissue necrosis that required medical counseling or intervention. 
      Long-term complications included functional or cosmetic outcomes that prompted 
      the patient to request or the surgeon to offer additional intervention. RESULTS: 
      Of the 1008 patients included in the study (396 women and 612 men), the median 
      (SD) age was 70 (12) years (range, 21-90 years). A total of 128 patients (12.7%) 
      were current smokers, 385 (38.2%) were former smokers, and 495 (49.1%) were never 
      smokers. On multivariate logistic regression, current smoking (odds ratio [OR], 
      9.58; 95% CI, 3.63-25.3), former smoking (OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.41-9.38), larger 
      defect size (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.58-3.20), and the use of free cartilage graft 
      (OR, 8.19; 95% CI, 2.02-33.1) were associated with increased risks of acute 
      complications. For long-term complications, central face location (OR, 25.4; 95% 
      CI, 6.16-106.5), use of interpolation flap or flap-graft combination (OR, 3.49; 
      95% CI, 1.81-6.74), larger flap size (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09-1.87), and basal 
      cell carcinomas or other basaloid tumors (OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.03-11.5) were 
      associated with an increased risk, whereas increased age (OR, 0.66 per 10-year 
      interval; 95% CI, 0.54-0.80) was associated with decreased risk. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: This study suggests that both current and former smokers are at 
      increased risk for acute postsurgical complications but that smoking status is 
      not associated with long-term complications. These findings may allow the surgeon 
      to better quantify the magnitude of risk and provide helpful information for 
      patient counseling. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

TI  - CICAFAST: comparison of a biological dressing composed of fetal fibroblasts and 
      keratinocytes on a split-thickness skin graft donor site versus a traditional 
      dressing: a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wound repair is one of the most complex biological processes of human 
      life. Allogeneic cell-based engineered skin substitutes provide off-the-shelf 
      temporary wound coverage and act as biologically active dressings, releasing 
      growth factors, cytokines and extracellular matrix components essential for 
      proper wound healing. However, they are susceptible to immune rejection and this 
      is their major weakness. Thanks to their low immunogenicity and high 
      effectiveness in regeneration, fetal skin cells represent an attractive 
      alternative to the commonly used autologous and allogeneic skin grafts. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: We developed a new dressing comprising a collagen matrix seeded 
      with a specific ratio of active fetal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. These 
      produce a variety of healing growth factors and cytokines which will increase the 
      speed of wound healing and induce an immunotolerant state, with a slight 
      inflammatory reaction and a reduction in pain. The objective of this study is to 
      demonstrate that the use of this biological dressing for wound healing at the 
      split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor site, reduces the time to healing, 
      decreases other co-morbidities, such as pain, and improves the appearance of the 
      scar. This investigation will be conducted as part of a randomized study 
      comparing our new biological dressing with a conventional treatment in a single 
      patient, thus avoiding the factors that may influence the healing of a graft 
      donor site. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial should enable the development of a 
      new strategy for STSG donor-wound healing based on a regenerative dressing. The 
      pain experienced in the first few days of STSG healing is well known due to the 
      exposure of sensory nerve endings. Reducing this pain will also reduce analgesic 
      drug intake and the duration of sick leave. Our biological dressing will meet the 
      essential need of surgeons to "re-crop" from existing donor sites, e.g., for 
      thermal-burn patients. By accelerating healing, improving the appearance of the 
      scar and reducing pain, we hope to improve the conditions of treatment for skin 
      grafts. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03334656 . Registered on 7

TI  - Clinical Experience and Best Practices Using Epidermal Skin Grafts on Wounds.
PG  - 282-92
AB  - Over the years, autologous skin grafting has been used extensively to achieve 
      wound closure, optimize a functional scar, and improve aesthetic outcomes for the 
      patient. Although a vast majority of the literature is on the use of 
      full-thickness and split-thickness skin grafts, epidermal skin grafts (ESGs) have 
      emerged as a viable option in the reconstructive ladder when only the epidermal 
      layer is needed. These grafts are distinct from other types of autologous skin 
      grafts in that they can be harvested without anesthesia and leave minimal or no 
      scarring at the donor site. In order to explore the use of ESGs in the continuum 
      of primary wound closure, a multidisciplinary expert panel convened in October 
      2014, in Las Vegas, NV, to review the scientific basis and clinical uses of 
      epidermal grafting. This publication provides an overview of epidermal grafting, 
      recommendations for graft application, and potential roles for its use in wound 
      care and closure.

TI  - IRF4 ablation in B cells abrogates allogeneic B cell responses and prevents 
      chronic transplant rejection.

AB  - BACKGOUND: B cells contribute to chronic transplant rejection by producing 
      donor-specific antibodies and promoting T cell response, but how these processes 
      are regulated at the transcriptional level remains unclear. Herein, we 
      investigate the role of transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 
      (IRF4) in controlling B cell response during chronic transplant rejection. 
      METHODS: We generated the Irf4(gfp) reporter mice to determine IRF4 expression in 
      B cell lineage. We then used mice with B cell-specific IRF4 deletion to define 
      the role of IRF4 in B cell response after NP-KLH immunization or allogeneic heart 
      transplantation. In particular, graft survival and histology, as well as B and T 
      cell responses, were evaluated after transplantation. RESULTS: IRF4 is 
      dynamically expressed at different stages of B cell development and is absent in 
      germinal center (GC) B cells. However, IRF4 ablation in the B cell lineage 
      primarily eliminates GC B cells in both naïve and NP-KLH immunized mice. In the 
      transplantation setting, IRF4 functions intrinsically in B cells and governs 
      allogeneic B cell responses at multiple levels, including GC B cell generation, 
      plasma cell differentiation, donor-specific antibody production, and support of T 
      cell response. B cell-specific IRF4 deletion combined with transient CTLA4-Ig 
      treatment abrogates acute and chronic cardiac allograft rejection in naïve 
      recipient mice but not in donor skin-sensitized recipients. CONCLUSIONS: B cells 
      require IRF4 to mediate chronic transplant rejection. IRF4 ablation in B cells 
      abrogates allogeneic B cell responses and may also inhibit the ability of B cells 
      to prime allogenic T cells. Targeting IRF4 in B cells represents a potential 
      therapeutic strategy for eliminating chronic transplant rejection.

AB  - Antibody-mediated allograft rejection (AMR) causes more kidney transplant failure 
      than any other single cause. AMR is mediated by antibodies recognizing antigens 
      expressed by the graft, and antibodies generated against major histocompatibility 
      complex (MHC) mismatches are especially problematic. Most research directed 
      towards the management of clinical AMR has focused on identifying and 
      characterizing circulating donor-specific HLA antibody (DSA) and optimizing 
      therapies that reduce B-cell activation and/or block antibody secretion by 
      inhibiting plasmacyte survival. Here we describe a novel set of reagents and 
      techniques to allow more specific measurements of MHC sensitization across 
      different animal transplant models. Additionally, we have used these approaches 
      to isolate and clone individual HLA-specific B cells from patients sensitized by 
      pregnancy or transplantation. We have identified and characterized the phenotypes 
      of individual HLA-specific B cells, determined the V(D)J rearrangements of their 
      paired H and L chains, and generated recombinant antibodies to determine affinity 
      and specificity. Knowledge of the BCR genes of individual HLA-specific B cells 
      will allow identification of clonally related B cells by high-throughput sequence 
      analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and permit us to re-construct the 
      origins of HLA-specific B cells and follow their somatic evolution by mutation 
      and selection.

AB  - Early acute rejection of human allografts is mediated by circulating alloreactive 
      host effector memory T cells (TEM). TEM infiltration typically occurs across 
      graft postcapillary venules and involves sequential interactions with 
      graft-derived endothelial cells (ECs) and pericytes (PCs). While the role of ECs 
      in allograft rejection has been extensively studied, contributions of PCs to this 
      process are largely unknown. This study aimed to characterize the effects and 
      mechanisms of interactions between human PCs and allogeneic TEM. We report that 
      unstimulated PCs, like ECs, can directly present alloantigen to TEM, but while 
      IFN-γ-activated ECs (γ-ECs) show increased ability to stimulate alloreactive T 
      cells, IFN-γ-activated PCs (γ-PCs) instead suppress TEM proliferation but not 
      cytokine production or signaling. RNA sequencing analysis of PCs, γ-PCs, ECs, and 
      γ-ECs reveal induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in γ-PCs to 
      significantly higher levels than in γ-ECs that correlates with tryptophan 
      depletion in vitro. Consistently, shRNA knockdown of IDO1 markedly reduces 
      γ-PC-mediated immunoregulatory effects. Furthermore, human PCs express IDO1 in a 
      skin allograft rejection humanized mouse model and in human renal allografts with 
      acute T cell-mediated rejection. We conclude that immunosuppressive properties of 
      human PCs are not intrinsic but instead result from IFN-γ-induced IDO1-mediated 
      tryptophan depletion.

TI  - Natural Reconstruction: A Comprehensive Standardized Operating Procedure for 
      Restoring Eyebrow Loss Due to Scarring.
PG  - 877-886
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000009564 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scarring that results in eyebrow loss is a cosmetic problem that can 
      result in severe psychological distress. Although hair transplantation is 
      increasingly used for eyebrow restoration, graft loss may occur, preventing 
      achievement of desired results. Single-hair follicle transplantation, however, 
      may be effective. The authors describe outcomes of a standardized method of 
      eyebrow reconstruction, involving single-hair follicle transplantation combined 
      with follicular unit extraction, in patients with absent eyebrows because of 
      scarring. METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee 
      of Nanfang Hospital and all patients provided written informed consent before 
      surgery. The medical records of patients who underwent eyebrow reconstruction 
      from 2012 to 2019 for eyebrow loss caused by scar formation were reviewed 
      retrospectively. Outcomes evaluated included satisfaction, graft survival rate, 
      and long-term complications. A nine-step standardized operating procedure was 
      established for eyebrow reconstruction in patients with eyebrow absence 
      attributable to scarring. RESULTS: During the study period, 167 patients (205 
      eyebrows) underwent eyebrow reconstruction. Following the first stage of 
      reconstruction, 95 percent of patients were highly satisfied with the density and 
      natural appearance of their eyebrows. The average graft survival rate was 85 
      percent (range, 70 to 90 percent), significantly higher than the 75 percent 
      survival rate previously reported. Fewer than 5 percent of patients underwent the 
      second stage of reconstruction, with these patients expressing satisfaction with 
      their outcomes. No obvious complications were observed. CONCLUSION: This 
      standardized method may optimize outcomes in patients with eyebrow absence 
      attributable to scarring. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.

TI  - Four cases of abdominal expander implantation in adult chronic osteomyelitis of 
      lower extremity with soft tissue defect and literature review.
PG  - 1980-1989
LID - 10.1111/iwj.13798 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we intend to explore the clinical efficacy of abdominal expander 
      implantation combined with flap technique in adult chronic osteomyelitis of lower 
      limb with soft tissue defects, and to provide the basis for the promotion of the 
      technique in clinical practice. Four patients diagnosed with chronic 
      osteomyelitis of lower extremity with soft tissue defect were enrolled in this 
      prospective study. Evaluation indicators included state of flap survival, state 
      of abdominal incision, surrounding of abdominal wound scar, satisfaction of the 
      patient, state of flap survival half a year after surgery, whether the 3D 
      prosthesis is successfully implanted and limb movement. Four patients had 
      complete flap survival, two of whom had a small amount of skin graft survival 
      disorder in the vascular pedicle area, which improved after 1 month of dressing 
      change. The expander had an average expansion time of 31.5 days, an average water 
      injection of 525 mL, and an average skin volume taken of 159 cm(2) . No incision 
      exudation, incision dehiscence, subcutaneous exudate and other complications 
      occurred. The mean Vancouver Scar Scale score at 3 months after surgery was 3.5 
      (range from 3 to 6) points. Four patients showed good flap survival at six-month 
      follow-up. 3D printed prosthesis were all successfully implanted. The treatment 
      of adult chronic osteomyelitis of lower extremities with lower abdominal 
      implantable expander combined with flap technique can effectively increase the 
      skin harvesting area, reduce the suture tension of abdominal skin harvesting area 
      and the scar hyperplasia of abdominal skin harvesting area.

TI  - Local Burn Injury Promotes Defects in the Epidermal Lipid and Antimicrobial 
      Peptide Barriers in Human Autograft Skin and Burn Margin: Implications for Burn 
      Wound Healing and Graft Survival.
PG  - e212-e226
LID - 10.1097/BCR.0000000000000357 [doi]
AB  - Burn injury increases the risk of morbidity and mortality by promoting severe 
      hemodynamic shock and risk for local or systemic infection. Graft failure due to 
      poor wound healing or infection remains a significant problem for burn subjects. 
      The mechanisms by which local burn injury compromises the epithelial 
      antimicrobial barrier function in the burn margin, containing the elements 
      necessary for healing of the burn site, and in distal unburned skin, which serves 
      as potential donor tissue, are largely unknown. The objective of this study was 
      to establish defects in epidermal barrier function in human donor skin and burn 
      margin, to identify potential mechanisms that may lead to graft failure and/or 
      impaired burn wound healing. In this study, we established that epidermal lipids 
      and respective lipid synthesis enzymes were significantly reduced in both donor 
      skin and burn margin. We further identified diverse changes in the gene 
      expression and protein production of several candidate skin antimicrobial 
      peptides (AMPs) in both donor skin and burn margin. These results also parallel 
      changes in cutaneous AMP activity against common burn wound pathogens, aberrant 
      production of epidermal proteases known to regulate barrier permeability and AMP 
      activity, and greater production of proinflammatory cytokines known to be induced 
      by AMPs. These findings suggest that impaired epidermal lipid and AMP regulation 
      could contribute to graft failure and infectious complications in subjects with 
      burn or other traumatic injury.

PG  - 61-70
LID - 10.1097/BCR.0000000000000401 [doi]
AB  - Stable closure of full-thickness burn wounds remains a limitation to recovery 
      from burns of greater than 50% of the total body surface area (TBSA). 
      Hypothetically, engineered skin substitutes (ESS) consisting of autologous 
      keratinocytes and fibroblasts attached to collagen-based scaffolds may reduce 
      requirements for donor skin, and decrease mortality. ESS were prepared from 
      split-thickness skin biopsies collected after enrollment of 16 pediatric burn 
      patients into an approved study protocol. ESS and split-thickness autograft (AG) 
      were applied to 15 subjects with full-thickness burns involving a mean of 76.9% 
      TBSA. Data consisted of photographs, tracings of donor skin and healed wounds, 
      comparison of mortality with the National Burn Repository, correlation of TBSA 
      closed wounds with TBSA full-thickness burn, frequencies of regrafting, and 
      immunoreactivity to the biopolymer scaffold. One subject expired before ESS 
      application, and 15 subjects received 2056 ESS grafts. The ratio of closed wound 
      to donor areas was 108.7 ± 9.7 for ESS compared with a maximum of 4.0 ± 0.0 for 
      AG. Mortality for enrolled subjects was 6.25%, and 30.3% for a comparable 
      population from the National Burn Repository (P < .05). Engraftment was 
      83.5 ± 2.0% for ESS and 96.5 ± 0.9% for AG. Percentage TBSA closed was 
      29.9 ± 3.3% for ESS, and 47.0 ± 2.0% for AG. These values were significantly 
      different between the graft types. Correlation of % TBSA closed with ESS with % 
      TBSA full-thickness burn generated an R value of 0.65 (P < .001). These results 
      indicate that autologous ESS reduce mortality and requirements for donor skin 
      harvesting, for grafting of full-thickness burns of greater than 50% TBSA.

AB  - Chemokines regulate tissue immunity by recruiting specific subsets of immune 
      cells. Mice expressing the E7 protein of human papilloma virus 16 as a transgene 
      from a keratin 14 promoter (K14.E7) show increased epidermal and dermal 
      lymphocytic infiltrates, epidermal hyperplasia, and suppressed local immunity. 
      Here, we show that CXCL9 and CXCL10 are overexpressed in non-hematopoietic cells 
      in skin of K14.E7 mice when compared with non-transgenic animals, and recruit 
      CXCR3(+) lymphocytes to the hyperplastic skin. Overexpression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 
      is not observed in E7 transgenic mice with mutated Rb gene whose protein product 
      cannot interact with E7 (K14.E7xRb(ΔL/ΔL)) and in consequence lack hyperplastic 
      epithelium. CXCR3(+) T cells are preferentially recruited by CXCL9 and CXCL10 in 
      supernatants of K14.E7 but not K14.E7xRb(ΔL/ΔL) skin cultures in vitro. CXCR3 
      signalling promotes infiltration of a subset of effector T lymphocytes that 
      enables donor lymphocyte deficient, E7-expressing skin graft rejection. Taken 
      together, this suggests that recruitment of CXCR3(+) T cells can be an important 
      factor in the rejection of precancerous skin epithelium providing they can 
      overcome local immunosuppressive mechanisms driven by skin-resident lymphocytes.

TI  - Pretransplant Desensitization with Costimulation Blockade and Proteasome 
      Inhibitor Reduces DSA and Delays Antibody-Mediated Rejection in Highly Sensitized 
      Nonhuman Primate Kidney Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 2399-2411
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2019030304 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with broad HLA sensitization have poor access to donor 
      organs, high mortality while waiting for kidney transplant, and inferior graft 
      survival. Although desensitization strategies permit transplantation via lowering 
      of donor-specific antibodies, the B cell-response axis from germinal center 
      activation to plasma cell differentiation remains intact. METHODS: To investigate 
      targeting the germinal center response and plasma cells as a desensitization 
      strategy, we sensitized maximally MHC-mismatched rhesus pairs with two sequential 
      skin transplants. We administered a proteasome inhibitor (carfilzomib) and 
      costimulation blockade agent (belatacept) to six animals weekly for 1 month; four 
      controls received no treatment. We analyzed blood, lymph node, bone marrow cells, 
      and serum before desensitization, after desensitization, and after kidney 
      transplantation. RESULTS: The group receiving carfilzomib and belatacept 
      exhibited significantly reduced levels of donor-specific antibodies (P=0.05) and 
      bone marrow plasma cells (P=0.02) compared with controls, with a trend toward 
      reduced lymph node T follicular helper cells (P=0.06). Compared with controls, 
      carfilzomib- and belatacept-treated animals had significantly prolonged graft 
      survival (P=0.02), and renal biopsy at 1 month showed significantly reduced 
      antibody-mediated rejection scores (P=0.02). However, four of five animals with 
      long-term graft survival showed gradual rebound of donor-specific antibodies and 
      antibody-mediated rejection. CONCLUSIONS: Desensitization using proteasome 
      inhibition and costimulation blockade reduces bone marrow plasma cells, 
      disorganizes germinal center responses, reduces donor-specific antibody levels, 
      and prolongs allograft survival in highly sensitized nonhuman primates. Most 
      animals experienced antibody-mediated rejection with humoral-response rebound, 
      suggesting desensitization must be maintained after transplantation using ongoing 
      suppression of the B cell response.

AB  - Preventing rejection is a major challenge in transplantation medicine, even when 
      using pluripotent stem cell-derived grafts. In iPS cell (iPSC)-based 
      transplantation, to reduce the risk of rejection, it is thought to be optimal 
      that preparing the cells from donors whose human leukocyte antigen-haplotype are 
      homozygous. Generally, this approach is referred to as major histocompatibility 
      complex (MHC) homo-to-hetero transplantation, which is MHC-matched but minor 
      antigen-mismatched. To investigate the immune response in the MHC homo-to-hetero 
      transplantation, we established a murine experimental system in which MHC-matched 
      but minor antigen-mismatched tissue (skin) grafts were transplanted into 
      MHC-heterozygous recipients. Unexpectedly, only minor antigen-mismatched grafts 
      were rejected at the same time points as rejection of fully allogeneic grafts. A 
      vigorous anti-donor type T cell response was detected in vitro and conventional 
      immunosuppressants targeting T cell activation had limited effects on controlling 
      rejection. However, anti-donor antibodies were not detected only in the minor 
      antigen-mismatched transplantation. This murine transplantation model can be used 
      to further analyze immunological subjects for MHC homo-to-hetero iPSC-based 
      transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tangential excision of burned tissue followed by skin grafting is the 
      cornerstone of burn surgery. Hydrosurgery has become popular for tangential 
      excision, with the hypothesis that enhanced preservation of vital dermal tissue 
      reduces scarring. The aim of this trial was to compare scar quality after 
      hydrosurgical versus conventional debridement before split-skin grafting. 
      METHODS: A double-blind randomized within-patient multicentre controlled trial 
      was conducted in patients with burns that required split-skin grafting. One wound 
      area was randomized to hydrosurgical debridement and the other to Weck knife 
      debridement. The primary outcome was scar quality at 12 months, assessed with the 
      observer part of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). 
      Secondary outcomes included complications, scar quality, colour, pliability, and 
      histological dermal preservation. RESULTS: Some 137 patients were randomized. At 
      12 months, scars of the hydrosurgical debrided wounds had a lower POSAS observer 
      total item score (mean 2.42 (95 per cent c.i. 2.26 to 2.59) versus 2.54 (95 per 
      cent c.i. 2.36 to 2.72; P = 0.023)) and overall opinion score (mean 3.08 (95 per 
      cent c.i. 2.88 to 3.28) versus 3.30 (95 per cent c.i. 3.09-3.51); P = 0.006). 
      Patient-reported scar quality and pliability measurements were significantly 
      better for the hydrosurgically debrided wounds. Complication rates did not differ 
      between both treatments. Histologically, significantly more dermis was preserved 
      with hydrosurgery (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: One year after surgery scar quality 
      and pliability was better for hydrosurgically debrided burns, probably owing to 
      enhanced histological preservation of dermis. REGISTRATION NUMBER: Trial NL6085

TI  - Blocking CD226 Promotes Allogeneic Transplant Immune Tolerance and Improves Skin 
      Graft Survival by Increasing the Frequency of Regulatory T Cells in a Murine 
      Model.
PG  - 2338-2350
LID - 10.1159/000488182 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play key roles in maintaining 
      peripheral tolerance and preventing autoimmune disease. Treg modulation could be 
      helpful in treating malignancies, autoimmune disease, and allergies, as well as 
      to facilitate organ transplantation. Signals transduced by co-stimulatory 
      molecules are essential for Treg differentiation, homeostasis, and function. One 
      well-known active receptor, CD226, also known as DNAM-1 or PTA1, is an adhesion 
      molecule that interacts primarily with CD155 and is involved in Treg 
      differentiation and immune tolerance to transplanted tissue. METHODS: Anti-CD226 
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) and truncated recombinant CD226 proteins were employed 
      to manipulate the CD226 signal. Various T cell markers on freshly isolated 
      splenocytes and T lymphocytes were characterized by flow cytometry Cell 
      proliferation was measured by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester dye, mRNA 
      transcripts by q-RT PCR, and protein expression by western blotting. A 
      BALB/c-to-C57BL/6 skin allograft model was used to determine the effects of CD226 
      blocking treatment. RESULTS: We observed that both intact extracellular domains 
      of CD226 were necessary for functional interaction of the receptor with its 
      ligand CD155, even though one domain was shown to bind CD155 with lower affinity 
      in a solid binding assay. Importantly, CD226 mAb promoted Treg expansion in a 
      mixed lymphocyte culture and inhibited the cytotoxicity of effector cells. In 
      allogeneic skin transplant mice, administering CD226 mAb reduced inflammation and 
      prolonged allogeneic graft survival, with an increase in the frequency of Tregs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the mechanism underlying CD226-CD155 interactions 
      and indicate that CD226 signals can be manipulated to promote Treg expansion. 
      Moreover, we provide new evidence that suggests the therapeutic potential of 
      anti-CD226 with allogeneic transplantation.

AB  - A robust regimen for inducing allogeneic transplantation tolerance involves 
      pre-emptive recipient treatment with donor splenocytes (SP) rendered apoptotic by 
      1-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide(ECDI) treatment. However, such a 
      regimen is limited by availability of donor cells, cost of cell procurement, and 
      regulatory hurdles associated with cell-based therapies. Nanoparticles (NP) 
      delivering donor antigens are a promising alternative for promoting 
      transplantation tolerance. Here, we used a B6.C-H-2(bm12)(bm12) to C57BL/6(B6) 
      skin transplant model involving a defined major histocompatibility antigen 
      mismatch to investigate design parameters of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) NPs 
      delivering peptides containing the donor antigen for optimizing skin allograft 
      survival. We showed that an epitope-containing short peptide (P1) was more 
      effective than a longer peptide (P2) at providing graft protection. Importantly, 
      the NP and P1 complex (NP-ECDI-P1) resulted in a significant expansion of 
      graft-infiltrating Tregs. Interestingly, in comparison to donor ECDI-SP that 
      provided indefinite graft protection, NP-ECDI-P1 targeted different splenic 
      phagocytes and skin allografts in these recipients harbored significantly more 
      graft-infiltrating CD8(+)IFN-γ(+) cells. Collectively, the current study provides 
      initial engineering parameters for a cell-free and biocompatible NP-peptide 
      platform for transplant immunoregulation. Moreover, it also provides guidance to 
      future NP engineering endeavors to recapitulate the effects of donor ECDI-SP as a 
      goal for maximizing tolerance efficacy of NP formulations.

TI  - Ex vivo allotransplantation engineering: Delivery of mesenchymal stem cells 
      prolongs rejection-free allograft survival.

AB  - Current pharmacologic regimens in transplantation prevent allograft rejection 
      through systemic recipient immunosuppression but are associated with severe 
      morbidity and mortality. The ultimate goal of transplantation is the prevention 
      of allograft rejection while maintaining recipient immunocompetence. We 
      hypothesized that allografts could be engineered ex vivo (after allotransplant 
      procurement but before transplantation) by using mesenchymal stem cell-based 
      therapy to generate localized immunomodulation without affecting systemic 
      recipient immunocompetence. To this end, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of 
      bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and activated them toward an 
      immunomodulatory fate by priming in inflammatory or hypoxic microenvironments. 
      Using an established rat hindlimb model for allotransplantation, we were able to 
      significantly prolong rejection-free allograft survival with a single 
      perioperative ex vivo infusion of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells 
      through the allograft vasculature, in the absence of long-term pharmacologic 
      immunosuppression. Critically, transplanted rats rejected a second, nonengineered 
      skin graft from the same donor species to the contralateral limb at a later date, 
      demonstrating that recipient systemic immunocompetence remained intact. This 
      study represents a novel approach in transplant immunology and highlights the 
      significant therapeutic opportunity of the ex vivo period in transplant 
      engineering.

TI  - Host-versus-commensal immune responses participate in the rejection of colonized 
      solid organ transplants.
LID - 10.1172/JCI153403 [doi]
LID - e153403
AB  - Solid organ transplantation is the preferred treatment for end-stage organ 
      failure. Although transplant recipients take life-long immunosuppressive drugs, a 
      substantial percentage of them still reject their allografts. Strikingly, barrier 
      organs colonized with microbiota have significantly shorter half-lives than 
      non-barrier transplanted organs, even in immunosuppressed hosts. We previously 
      demonstrated that skin allografts monocolonized with the common human commensal 
      Staphylococcus epidermidis (S.epi) are rejected faster than germ-free (GF) 
      allografts in mice because the presence of S.epi augments the effector alloimmune 
      response locally in the graft. Here, we tested whether host immune responses 
      against graft-resident commensal microbes, including S.epi, can damage colonized 
      grafts independently from the alloresponse. Naive hosts mounted an anticommensal 
      T cell response to colonized, but not GF, syngeneic skin grafts. Whereas naive 
      antigraft commensal T cells modestly damaged colonized syngeneic skin grafts, 
      hosts with prior anticommensal T cell memory mounted a post-transplant immune 
      response against graft-resident commensals that significantly damaged colonized, 
      syngeneic skin grafts. Importantly, allograft recipients harboring this 
      host-versus-commensal immune response resisted immunosuppression. The dual 
      effects of host-versus-commensal and host-versus-allograft responses may 
      partially explain why colonized organs have poorer outcomes than sterile organs 
      in the clinic.

TI  - CHBP induces stronger immunosuppressive CD127(+) M-MDSC via erythropoietin 
      receptor.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO) is not only an erythropoiesis hormone but also an 
      immune-regulatory cytokine. The receptors of EPO (EPOR)(2) and tissue-protective 
      receptor (TPR), mediate EPO's immune regulation. Our group firstly reported a 
      non-erythropoietic peptide derivant of EPO, cyclic helix B peptide (CHBP), which 
      could inhibit macrophages inflammation and dendritic cells (DCs) maturation. As a 
      kind of innate immune regulatory cell, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) 
      share a common myeloid progenitor with macrophages and DCs. In this study, we 
      investigated the effects on MDSCs differentiation and immunosuppressive function 
      via CHBP induction. CHBP promoted MDSCs differentiate toward M-MDSCs with 
      enhanced immunosuppressive capability. Infusion of CHBP-induced M-MDSCs 
      significantly prolonged murine skin allograft survival compared to its 
      counterpart without CHBP stimulation. In addition, we found CHBP increased the 
      proportion of CD11b(+)Ly6G(-)Ly6C(high) CD127(+) M-MDSCs, which exerted a 
      stronger immunosuppressive function compared to CD11b(+)Ly6G(-)Ly6C(high) 
      CD127(-) M-MDSCs. In CHBP induced M-MDSCs, we found that EPOR downstream signal 
      proteins Jak2 and STAT3 were upregulated, which had a strong relationship with 
      MDSC function. In addition, CHBP upregulated GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) 
      protein translation level, which was an upstream signal of CD127 and regulator of 
      STAT3. These effects of CHBP could be reversed if Epor was deficient. Our novel 
      findings identified a new subset of M-MDSCs with better immunosuppressive 
      capability, which was induced by the EPOR-mediated Jak2/GATA3/STAT3 pathway. 
      These results are beneficial for CHBP clinical translation and MDSC cell therapy 
      in the future.

TI  - Preconditioned hyperbaric oxygenation protects skin flap grafts in rats against 
      ischemia/reperfusion injury.
PG  - 2124-30

AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is an effective therapy for ischemia/reperfusion 
      (I/R) injury of the brain, small intestine, testes and liver. However, the 
      detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of HBO therapy remain 
      undetermined. In the current study, the hypothesis that preconditioning rats with 
      HBO protects grafted skin flaps against subsequent I/R injury was investigated. 
      In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying HBO therapy were characterized 
      by analyzing the roles of the following important inflammatory factors: High 
      mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1) and nuclear factor-κ B (NF-κB). A total of 40 
      rats were randomly divided into the following five groups: (i) Sham surgery (SH); 
      (ii) ischemia followed by reperfusion 3 days following surgery (I/R3d); (iii) 
      ischemia followed by reperfusion 5 days following surgery (I/R5d); (iv) HBO 
      preconditioning (HBO-PC) and ischemia followed by reperfusion 3 days following 
      surgery (HBO-PC+3d); and (v) HBO-PC and ischemia followed by reperfusion 5 days 
      following surgery (HBO-PC+5d). For the surgical procedure, all pedicled skin 
      flaps were first measured and elevated (9x6 cm). The feeding vessels of the skin 
      flaps were subsequently clamped for 3 h and released to restore blood flow. The 
      rats in the HBO-PC+3d and HBO-PC+5d groups received 1 h HBO for 3 and 5 
      consecutive days, respectively, prior to surgery. Following surgery, the rats 
      were euthanized, and grafted tissues were collected for western blotting and 
      immunohistochemistry. HBO-PC increased blood perfusion in epigastric skin flaps 
      and attenuated I/R injury following skin flap graft. Additionally, the elevated 
      expression of HMGB1 and NF-κB proteins during I/R injury was attenuated by HBO-PC 
      treatment. HBO-PC may therefore be applied to reduce I/R injury and improve the 
      survival rate of grafted skin flaps. The molecular mechanisms underlying the 
      effect of HBO therapy are associated with the attenuation of inflammatory 
      responses.

AB  - The role of the vascularized bone marrow component as a continuous source of 
      donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells that facilitate tolerance induction of 
      vascularized composite allografts is not completely understood. In this study, 
      vascularized composite tissue allograft transplantation outcomes between 
      recipients receiving either conventional bone marrow transplantation (CBMT) or 
      vascularized bone marrow (VBM) transplantation from Balb/c (H2d) to C57BL/6 (H2b) 
      mice were compared. Either high- or low-dose CBMT (1.5 × 10(8) or 3 × 10(7) bone 
      marrow cells, respectively) was applied. In addition, recipients were treated 
      with costimulation blockade (1 mg anti-CD154 and 0.5 mg CTLA4Ig on postoperative 
      days 0 and 2, respectively) and short-term rapamycin (3 mg/kg/day for the first 
      posttransplant week and then every other day for another 3 weeks). Similar to 
      high-dose conventional bone marrow transplantation, 5/6 animals in the 
      vascularized bone marrow group demonstrated long-term allograft survival (>120 
      days). In contrast, significantly shorter median survival was noted in the 
      low-dose CBMT group (~64 days). Consistently high chimerism levels were observed 
      in the VBM transplantation group. Notably, low levels of circulating CD4(+) and 
      CD8(+) T cells and a higher ratio of Treg to Teff cells were maintained in VBM 
      transplantation and high-dose CBMT recipients (>30 days) but not in low-dose VBM 
      transplant recipients. Donor-specific hyporesponsiveness was shown in tolerant 
      recipients in vitro. Removal of the vascularized bone marrow component after 
      secondary donor-specific skin transplantation did not affect either primary 
      allograft or secondary skin graft survival.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to test the hypothesis that a simulated burn injury on 
      the torso will be no more or less detrimental to core temperature control than on 
      the limbs during uncompensable exercise-heat stress. METHODS: Nine nonburned 
      individuals (7 men, 2 women) completed the protocol. On separate occasions, burn 
      injuries of identical surface area (0.45 ± 0.08 m2 or 24.4% ± 4.4% of total body 
      surface area) were simulated on the torso or the arms/legs using an absorbent, 
      vapor-impermeable material that impedes sweat evaporation in those regions. 
      Participants performed 60 min of treadmill walking at 5.3 km·h-1 and a 4.1% ± 
      0.8% grade, targeting 6 W·kg-1 of metabolic heat production in 40.1°C ± 0.2°C and 
      19.6% ± 0.6% relative humidity conditions. Rectal temperature, heart rate, and 
      perceptual responses were measured. RESULTS: Rectal temperature increased to a 
      similar extent with simulated injuries on the torso and limbs (condition-by-time 
      interaction, P = 0.86), with a final rectal temperature 0.9°C ± 0.3°C above 
      baseline in both conditions. No differences in heart rate, perceived exertion, or 
      thermal sensation were observed between conditions (condition-by-time 
      interactions, P ≥ 0.50). CONCLUSIONS: During uncompensable exercise-heat stress, 
      sized-matched simulated burn injuries on the torso or limbs evoke comparable core 
      temperature, heart rate, and perceptual responses, suggesting that the risk of 
      exertional heat illness in such environmental conditions is independent of injury 
      location.

PG  - 131-8
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000000204 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously demonstrated that tolerance to a vascularized 
      composite allograft (VCA) can be achieved after the establishment of mixed 
      chimerism. We test the hypothesis that tolerance to a VCA in our dog leukocyte 
      antigen-matched canine model is not dependent on the previous establishment of 
      mixed chimerism and can be induced coincident with hematopoietic cell 
      transplantation (HCT). METHODS: Eight dog leukocyte antigen-matched, minor 
      antigen mismatched dogs received 200 cGy of radiation and a VCA transplant. Four 
      dogs received donor bone marrow at the time of VCA transplantation (group 1), 
      whereas a second group of four dogs did not (group 2). All recipients received a 
      limited course of postgrafting immunosuppression. All dogs that received HCT and 
      VCA were given donor, third-party, and autologous skin grafts. RESULTS: All group 
      1 recipients were tolerant to their VCA (>62 weeks). Three of the four dogs in 
      group 2 rejected their VCA transplants after the cessation of immunosuppression. 
      Biopsies obtained from the muscle and skin of VCA from group 1 showed few 
      infiltrating cells compared with extensive infiltrates in biopsies of VCA from 
      group 2. Compared with autologous skin and muscle, elevated levels of CD3+ FoxP3+ 
      T-regulatory cells were found in the skin and muscle obtained from the VCA of HCT 
      recipients. All group 1 animals were tolerant to their donor skin graft and 
      promptly rejected the third-party skin grafts. CONCLUSION: These data 
      demonstrated that donor-specific tolerance to all components of the VCA can be 
      established through simultaneous nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT and VCA 
      transplantation protocol.

AB  - Background. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of ASCs on 
      full-thickness skin grafts. Specifically, we investigated the anti-inflammatory 
      effects of ASCs that are mediated via regulation of the phenotypes of activated 
      macrophages. Methods. ASCs were isolated, cultured, and injected under 
      full-thickness skin grafts in 15 rats (ASC group). An additional 15 rats served 
      as controls (PBS group). Skin graft survival assessment and vascularization 
      detection were assessed with H&E staining and laser Doppler blood flowmetry 
      (LDF). The effects of ASCs on angiogenesis, anti-inflammation, collagen 
      accumulation-promoting, and antiscarring were assessed. Results. We found that 
      the skin graft survival rate was significantly increased in the ASC group. The 
      neovascularization, collagen deposition, collagen type I to type III ratio, and 
      levels of VEGF and TGF-β3 in the ASC group were markedly higher than those in the 
      PBS group at day 14. Additionally, in the ASC group, the levels of iNOS, IL-1β, 
      and TNF-α were remarkably decreased, whereas the levels of IL-10 and Arg-1 were 
      substantially increased. Conclusions. Our results confirm that ASCs 
      transplantation can effectively improve full-thickness skin graft survival. 
      Additionally, the anti-inflammatory role of ASCs may indirectly contribute to 
      skin graft survival via its effect on macrophage polarization.

TI  - In situ recruitment of regulatory T cells promotes donor-specific tolerance in 
      vascularized composite allotransplantation.

AB  - Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) encompasses face and limb 
      transplantation, but as with organ transplantation, it requires lifelong regimens 
      of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection. To achieve donor-specific immune 
      tolerance and reduce the need for systemic immunosuppression, we developed a 
      synthetic drug delivery system that mimics a strategy our bodies naturally use to 
      recruit regulatory T cells (T(reg)) to suppress inflammation. Specifically, a 
      microparticle-based system engineered to release the T(reg)-recruiting chemokine 
      CCL22 was used in a rodent hindlimb VCA model. These "Recruitment-MP" prolonged 
      hindlimb allograft survival indefinitely (>200 days) and promoted donor-specific 
      tolerance. Recruitment-MP treatment enriched T(reg) populations in allograft skin 
      and draining lymph nodes and enhanced T(reg) function without affecting the 
      proliferative capacity of conventional T cells. With implications for clinical 
      translation, synthetic human CCL22 induced preferential migration of human T(reg) 
      in vitro. Collectively, these results suggest that Recruitment-MP promote 
      donor-specific immune tolerance via local enrichment of suppressive T(reg).

TI  - A single-center, open-labeled, randomized, 6-month, parallel-group study to 
      assess the safety and efficacy of allogeneic cultured keratinocyte sheet 
      transplantation for deep second-degree burn wounds: rationale and design of phase 
      I/II clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Burn-related injuries are a major global health issue, causing 
      180,000 deaths per year. Early debridement of necrotic tissue in association with 
      a split-thickness skin graft is usually administered for some of the 2nd- and 
      3rd-degree injuries. However, this approach can be complicated by factors such as 
      a lack of proper donor sites. Artificial skin substitutes have attracted much 
      attention for burn-related injuries. Keratinocyte sheets are one of the skin 
      substitutes that their safety and efficacy have been reported by previous 
      studies. METHODS: Two consecutive clinical trials were designed, one of them is 
      phase I, a non-randomized, open-label trial with 5 patients, and phase II is a 
      randomized and open-label trial with 35 patients. A total number of 40 patients 
      diagnosed with 2nd-degree burn injury will receive allogenic keratinocyte sheet 
      transplantation. The safety and efficacy of allogeneic skin graft with autograft 
      skin transplantation and conventional treatments, including Vaseline dressing and 
      topical antibiotic, will be compared in different wounds of a single patient in 
      phase II. After the transplantation, patients will be followed up on days 3, 7, 
      10, 14, 21, and 28. In the 3rd and 6th months after the transplantation scar, a 
      wound closure assessment will be conducted based on the Vancouver Scar Scale and 
      the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. DISCUSSION: This study will 
      explain the design and rationale of a cellular-based skin substitute for the 
      first time in Iran. In addition, this work proposes this product being registered 
      as an off-the-shelf product for burn wound management in the country. TRIAL

TI  - Can Sural Fasciocutaneous Flaps Be Effective in Patients Older Than 65?
PG  - 734-738
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000000963 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies have evaluated the reverse sural fasciocutaneous flap 
      for coverage of wounds on the distal lower extremity, and many of these have 
      focused on younger, healthy patients. However, to our knowledge, there has been 
      no dedicated study focusing on older patients. We believe there is a generalized 
      concern about performing these procedures in older patients because of 
      microvascular changes associated with aging. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the 
      likelihood of flap survival in a small series of patients older than 64 years who 
      underwent reverse sural artery fasciocutaneous flap for coverage of lower 
      extremity wounds? (2) What additional procedures did patients undergo after 
      treatment with this flap? METHODS: From 2009 to 2018, we identified 16 patients, 
      64 years or older, who underwent a retrograde sural fasciocutaneous flap. 
      Patients were a mean (range) age of 71.5 years (64 to 87). The average size of 
      the flaps was 30 cm (range 12 to 64 cm). The reverse sural artery flap was 
      indicated when the skin could not be closed primarily and there was not a 
      suitable vascularized bed of tissue for a split-thickness skin graft. All 
      patients underwent a wide-based pedicle (3 cm to 4 cm), reverse sural artery 
      fasciocutaneous flap with all but one completed in a "flap delay" manner, between 
      2 to 7 days, and without the use of microsurgery or doppler. Thirteen flaps were 
      done to cover wounds that occurred over fractures while three were performed to 
      cover chronic wounds. We performed a retrospective review of the electronic 
      health record to ascertain patient comorbidities, age, timing of coverage, and 
      size of the wound. RESULTS: In all, 94% of flaps (15 of 16) survived with 100% 
      viability. One flap had 30% skin necrosis at the distal tip. The flap ultimately 
      healed with in-office wound care, and epithelization occurred over the intact 
      fascia. A total of five additional procedures were performed in five patients. 
      Although the flap ultimately healed, an 87-year-old patient with partial flap 
      necrosis ultimately elected for below-knee amputation for a persistent tibial 
      infected nonunion. Another patient, despite a healed flap, eventually underwent a 
      below-knee amputation 3 years later for a chronic osteomyelitis present before 
      undergoing the reverse sural flap. One patient developed a pseudomonal infection 
      of their Gustillo-Anderson IIIB open tibia fracture, resulting in a surgical 
      procedure for débridement, after which the flap healed. Two patients underwent 
      underlying hardware removal to relieve wound tension and allow for complete flap 
      healing. No patients underwent further coverage procedures. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      small series, we found fewer complications than have been observed in prior 
      studies, despite our series consisting solely of higher-risk, older patients. We 
      believe this may have been attributable to the period of delay before placing the 
      flap, which has been previously associated with higher flap survival and which 
      allows for an extra recipient-site débridement. We believe this procedure can be 
      performed by appropriately trained orthopaedic surgeons because it does not need 
      microsurgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

LID - e91709
AB  - The microbiome affects development and activity of the immune system, and may 
      modulate immune therapies, but there is little direct information about this 
      control in vivo. We studied how the microbiome affects regulation of human immune 
      cells in humanized mice. When humanized mice were treated with a cocktail of 4 
      antibiotics, there was an increase in the frequency of effector T cells in the 
      gut wall, circulating levels of IFN-γ, and appearance of anti-nuclear antibodies. 
      Teplizumab, a non-FcR-binding anti-CD3ε antibody, no longer delayed xenograft 
      rejection. An increase in CD8+ central memory cells and IL-10, markers of 
      efficacy of teplizumab, were not induced. IL-10 levels were only decreased when 
      the mice were treated with all 4 but not individual antibiotics. Antibiotic 
      treatment affected CD11b+CD11c+ cells, which produced less IL-10 and IL-27, and 
      showed increased expression of CD86 and activation of T cells when cocultured 
      with T cells and teplizumab. Soluble products in the pellets appeared to be 
      responsible for the reduced IL-27 expression in DCs. Similar changes in IL-10 
      induction were seen when human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured 
      with human stool samples. We conclude that changes in the microbiome may impact 
      the efficacy of immunosuppressive medications by altering immune regulatory 
      pathways.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: BAHA implants have been shown to be effective in certain forms of 
      conductive hearing loss, but the presence of the titanium abutment is responsible 
      for sometimes severe skin reactions. The objective of this study was to compare 
      two operative techniques: skin flap, and full-thickness skin graft. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Between January 2004 and January 2011, 72 patients were treated by BAHA 
      implant and 32 of these patients (total of 41 implants) were included in the 
      study. Two surgical techniques were used: full-thickness skin graft (n=21) and 
      skin flap (n=20). RESULTS: Four types of skin complications were observed: 
      necrosis, inflammation/infection, hypertrophic scar, and fixture loss due to 
      inadequate osseointegration. Complications requiring surgical revision were 
      observed in 20% of cases with the skin flap method and 38% of cases with the skin 
      graft technique, with no significant difference between the two groups (P=0.31). 
      CONCLUSION: The skin graft technique appears to be associated with a higher rate 
      of major complications. The most common complication is hypertrophic scar. The 
      apparently high complication rate in this series can be explained by a selection 
      bias (exclusion of a large number of complication-free patients).

AB  - Invasive graft biopsies assess the efficacy of immunosuppression through lagging 
      indicators of transplant rejection. We report on a microporous scaffold implant 
      as a minimally invasive immunological niche to assay rejection before graft 
      injury. Adoptive transfer of T cells into Rag2(-/-) mice with mismatched 
      allografts induced acute cellular allograft rejection (ACAR), with subsequent 
      validation in wild-type animals. Following murine heart or skin transplantation, 
      scaffold implants accumulate predominantly innate immune cells. The scaffold 
      enables frequent biopsy, and gene expression analyses identified biomarkers of 
      ACAR before clinical signs of graft injury. This gene signature distinguishes 
      ACAR and immunodeficient respiratory infection before injury onset, indicating 
      the specificity of the biomarkers to differentiate ACAR from other inflammatory 
      insult. Overall, this implantable scaffold enables remote evaluation of the early 
      risk of rejection, which could potentially be used to reduce the frequency of 
      routine graft biopsy, reduce toxicities by personalizing immunosuppression, and 
      prolong transplant life.

TI  - T follicular helper expansion and humoral-mediated rejection are independent of 
      the HVEM/BTLA pathway.
PG  - 497-510
LID - 10.1038/cmi.2015.101 [doi]
AB  - The molecular pathways contributing to humoral-mediated allograft rejection are 
      poorly defined. In this study, we assessed the role of the herpesvirus entry 
      mediator/B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (HVEM/BTLA) signalling pathway in the 
      context of antibody-mediated allograft rejection. An experimental setting was 
      designed to elucidate whether the blockade of HVEM/BTLA interactions could 
      modulate de novo induction of host antidonor-specific antibodies during the 
      course of graft rejection. To test this hypothesis, fully allogeneic major 
      histocompatibility complex-mismatched skin grafts were transplanted onto the 
      right flank of recipient mice that were treated with isotype control, anti-CD40L 
      or modulatory antibodies of the HVEM/BTLA signalling pathway. The frequencies of 
      CD4 T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (B220-, CD4+ CXCR5+ PD-1high), 
      extrafollicular helper cells (B220-, CD4+ CXCR5- PD-1+ and PD-1-) and germinal 
      centre (GC) B cells (B220+Fas+ GL7+) were analysed by flow cytometry in draining 
      and non-draining lymph nodes at day 10 post transplantation during the acute 
      phase of graft rejection. The host antidonor isotype-specific humoral immune 
      response was also assessed. Whereas blockade of the CD40/CD40L pathway was highly 
      effective in preventing the allogeneic humoral immune response, antibody-mediated 
      blockade of the HVEM/BTLA-interacting pathway affected neither the expansion of 
      Tfh cells nor the expansion of GC B cells. Consequently, the course of the host 
      antidonor antibody-mediated response proceeded normally, without detectable 
      evidence of impaired development. In summary, these data indicate that HVEM/BTLA 
      interactions are dispensable for the formation of de novo host antidonor 
      isotype-specific antibodies in transplantation.

TI  - On-target and direct modulation of alloreactive T cells by a nanoparticle

      alloskin transplantation.
PG  - 703-715
LID - 10.1080/10717544.2018.1447049 [doi]
AB  - Biomimetic nanoparticles have been reported as immune modulators in autoimmune 
      diseases and allograft rejections by numerous researchers. However, most of the 
      therapeutics carrying antigens, toxins or cytokines underlay the mechanism of 
      antigen presentation by cellular uptake of NPs through pinocytosis and 
      phagocytosis. Few researches focus on the direct and antigen-specific modulation 
      on T cells by NPs and combined use of multiple regulatory molecules. Here, 
      polylactic-co-glycolic acid nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) were fabricated as scaffold 
      to cocoupling H-2K(b)-Ig dimer, anti-Fas mAb, PD-L1-Fc, TGF-β and CD47-Fc for the 
      generation of alloantigen-presenting and tolerance-inducing NPs, termed killer 
      NPs and followed by i.v. injection into a single MHC-mismatched murine model of 
      alloskin transplantation. Three infusions prolonged alloskin graft survival for 
      45 days; depleted most of H-2K(b) alloreactive CD8(+) T cells in peripheral 
      blood, spleen and local graft, in an antigen-specific manner. The killer NPs 
      circulated throughout vasculature into various organs and local allograft, with a 
      retention time up to 30 h. They made contacts with CD8(+) T cells to facilitate 
      vigorous apoptosis, inhibit the activation and proliferation of alloreactive 
      CD8(+) T cells and induce regulatory T cells in secondary lymphoid organs, with 
      the greatly minimized uptake by phagocytes. More importantly, the impairment of 
      host overall immune function and visible organ toxicity were not found. Our 
      results provide the first experimental evidence for the direct and on-target 
      modulation on alloreactive T cells by the biodegradable 200-nm killer NPs via 
      co-presentation of alloantigen and multiple regulatory molecules, thus suggest a 
      novel antigen-specific immune modulator for allograft rejections.

TI  - IL-27Rα: A Novel Molecular Imaging Marker for Allograft Rejection.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21041315 [doi]
LID - 1315
AB  - Non-invasively monitoring allogeneic graft rejection with a specific marker is of 
      great importance for prognosis of patients. Recently, data revealed that IL-27Rα 
      was up-regulated in alloreactive CD4(+) T cells and participated in inflammatory 
      diseases. Here, we evaluated whether IL-27Rα could be used in monitoring 
      allogeneic graft rejection both in vitro and in vivo. Allogeneic (C57BL/6 donor 
      to BALB/c recipient) and syngeneic (BALB/c both as donor and recipient) skin 
      grafted mouse models were established. The expression of IL-27Rα in grafts was 
      detected. The radio-probe, (125)I-anti-IL-27Rα mAb, was prepared. Dynamic 
      whole-body phosphor-autoradiography, ex vivo biodistribution and 
      immunofluorescence staining were performed. The results showed that the highest 
      expression of IL-27Rα was detected in allogeneic grafts on day 10 post 
      transplantation (top period of allorejection). (125)I-anti-IL-27Rα mAb was 
      successfully prepared with higher specificity and affinity. Whole-body 
      phosphor-autoradiography showed higher radioactivity accumulation in allogeneic 
      grafts than syngeneic grafts on day 10. The uptake of (125)I-anti-IL-27Rα mAb in 
      allogeneic grafts could be almost totally blocked by pre-injection with excess 
      unlabeled anti-IL-27Rα mAb. Interestingly, we found that (125)I-anti-IL-27Rα mAb 
      accumulated in allogeneic grafts, along with weaker inflammation earlier on day 
      6. The high uptake of (125)I-anti-IL-27Rα mAb was correlated with the higher 
      infiltrated IL-27Rα positive cells (CD3(+)/CD68(+)) in allogeneic grafts. In 
      conclusion, IL-27Rα may be a novel molecular imaging marker to predict 
      allorejection.

TI  - Health-related quality of life and patient burden in patients with 
      split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds.

AB  - Split-thickness skin grafting is a common procedure to treat different kinds of 
      wounds. This systematic, multicentre, observational, cross-sectional study of 
      adult patients with split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor site wounds was 
      conducted to evaluate quality of life (QoL) impairments caused by donor site 
      wounds following split-thickness skin grafting. Therefore, 112 patients from 12 
      wound centres in Germany were examined based on patient and physician 
      questionnaires as well as a physical examination of the donor site wound. Most 
      indications for skin grafting were postsurgical treatment (n = 51; 42.5%) and 
      chronic wounds (n = 47; 39.2%). European QoL visual analoque scale (EQ VAS) 
      averaged 64.7 ± 23.3, European QoL 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) averaged 77.4 ± 30.0. 
      Wound-QoL (range: 0-4) was rated 0.8 ± 0.8 post-surgery and 0.4 ± 0.6 at the time 
      of survey (on average 21 weeks between the time points). Compared to averaged 
      Wound-QoL scores of chronic wounds donor site-related QoL impairments in 
      split-thickness skin-graft patients were less pronounced. There were significant 
      differences in patient burden immediately after surgery compared to the time of 
      the survey, with medium effect sizes. This supports the hypothesis that faster 
      healing of the donor site wound leads to more favourable patient-reported 
      outcomes.

AB  - Models of infection have shaped our understanding of programmed memory T cell 
      differentiation, yet whether these models apply to memory programming in the 
      context of transplantation has yet to be defined. Previous work has identified 
      differences in the response of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells to cognate antigen 
      based on the environment in which the antigen is presented. Thus, we hypothesized 
      that programming of antigen specific CD8(+) T cells responding to graft and 
      pathogen may be dissimilar. Here we find that antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells 
      primed by a skin graft contract faster than those primed by gammaherpesvirus 
      (gHV), yet are able to expand more rapidly upon rechallenge. Moreover, 
      graft-primed antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells exhibited higher frequencies of 
      cells secreting IL-2 and demonstrate lower expression of KLRG-1, which are 
      qualities suggestive of increased recall potential. Additionally, the expression 
      of CD127 at a memory time point suggests graft-elicited CD8(+) antigen specific T 
      cells are maintained in a less terminally-differentiated state compared to 
      gHV-elicited CD8(+) antigen specific T cells, despite fewer cells being present 
      at that time point. Taken together, our findings suggest that the surface marker 
      expression and functional profiles of T cells depends on the priming conditions 
      and may be used to predict immunologic risk following transplantation after 
      traditional allosensitization or heterologous immune priming.

TI  - Comparison of Outcomes of Early vs Delayed Graft Reconstruction of Mohs 
      Micrographic Surgery Defects.
PG  - 89-94
LID - 10.1001/jamafacial.2018.1204 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Reconstructing Mohs defects often requires grafting in the form of 
      full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) and composite grafts. These grafts can be 
      complicated by a variable and often indeterminable survival rate. Other 
      researchers have found that delaying FTSG reconstruction improves graft outcomes, 
      but the optimal interval between excision and reconstruction remains unclear, and 
      no study has examined the association between delaying composite graft 
      reconstruction and graft survival. OBJECTIVE: To review the outcomes of Mohs 
      micrographic surgery defect reconstruction using FTSG and composite grafts with 
      respect to patient- and surgery-specific variables, particularly early vs delayed 
      reconstruction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective, 
      single-institution cohort study assessed patients who underwent Mohs 
      reconstructive surgery from January 1, 2012, to January 1, 2018. No patients had 
      to be excluded for inadequate follow-up or incomplete medical records. Delayed 
      reconstruction was defined as greater than 6 days after Mohs excision, the third 
      quartile of the interval to reconstruction among our cohort. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Primary outcome was postoperative complications, including hematoma, 
      infection, dehiscence, epidermolysis, and partial or full graft loss. RESULTS: A 
      total of 320 defects were reconstructed with FTSG or composite grafts in 310 
      patients (median [range] age, 68 [21-96] years; 167 female [53.9%]) during the 
      6-year study period. The mean interval between the ablative and reconstructive 
      operations was 4.73 days (range, 0-35 days). Univariate logistic regression was 
      used to determine the significant indicators among patient and defect 
      characteristics analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression model found delayed 
      reconstruction to have a protective association (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 
      0.27-0.97; P = .046) and male sex to have a harmful association (odds ratio, 
      2.51; 95% CI, 1.52-4.20; P < .001) with postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: This study found that delaying reconstruction in FTSGs and 
      composite grafts was associated with decreased rates of postoperative 
      complications, and male sex was associated with an increased risk of 
      postoperative complications. The findings suggest that this strategy can be 
      considered in patients at increased risk for developing postoperative 
      complications, such as current smokers, patients with large defects, and patients 
      who require use of composite grafts. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

AB  - γδ T cells represent a small fraction of total T cells in the body and do not use 
      classical polymorphic major histocompatibility complex‒loaded peptides for 
      mounting an immune response. The importance of the effector and regulatory 
      function of γδ T cells in infections, autoimmunity, and tumor models are well 
      characterized. In this study, we investigated the mechanistic role of γδ T cells 
      in costimulatory blockade‒induced transplantation tolerance. We used 
      donor-specific transfusion and anti-CD40L treatment in C57BL/6 mice to induce 
      tolerance to BALB/c skin allografts. We show that depletion of γδ T cells, 
      specifically Vγ2(+) γδ T cells, led to the acute rejection of skin allografts 
      despite tolerogen treatment. Tolerogen treatment promoted CD39(+)Vγ2(+) γδ T 
      cells and suppressed IFN-γ‒producing Vγ2(+) γδ T cells in the spleen and 
      allografts. Vγ2(+) γδ T cells isolated from tolerized mice suppress T helper type 
      1 cell differentiation. Adoptive transfer of these regulatory Vγ2(+) γδ T cells 
      prolonged the survival of allografts in an untreated recipient and Tcrδ(‒/‒) 
      mice. Together, our data show that the Vγ2(+) subset promotes costimulatory 
      blockade‒induced survival of skin allografts and that tolerogenic Vγ2(+) T cells 
      can be used as an adoptive cellular therapy to promote the survival of 
      allografts.

TI  - MicroRNA 26a prolongs skin allograft survival and promotes regulatory T cell 
      expansion in mice.
PG  - 1143-51
LID - 10.1111/tri.12590 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNA 26a (Mir-26a) has been reported to play functions in cellular 
      differentiation, cell growth, cell apoptosis, and metastasis. However, the role 
      of Mir-26a in transplant rejection has never been investigated. Full-thickness 
      skin grafts 1-2 cm in diameter were obtained from the tail-skin CBA/J donor mice 
      and transplanted onto the back of wild-type C57Bl/6 recipient mice. Vectors 
      encoding pre-Mir-26a (LV-26a) and an empty lentiviral vector (LV-Con) delivered 
      approximately 2 × 10(7) transforming units of recombinant lentivirus were 
      injected to mice once through the tail vein. Mir-26a overexpression results in 
      prolonged skin allograft survival (MST = 9.5 days in LV-Con mice; MST = 22 days 
      in LV-26a mice. P < 0.01) and promoted regulatory T cells (Tregs) expansion. The 
      prolonged skin allograft survival induced by LV-26a was abrogated by depletion of 
      Tregs with anti-CD25 antibodies. Mir-26a significantly promoted IL-10 expression 
      and suppressed the expression of IL-6, IL-17, and IFN-γ. Furthermore, IL-6 
      overexpression led to complete suppression of the Mir-26a-induced upregulation of 
      Foxp3. The prolonged allograft survival induced by LV-Mir-26a was also completely 
      abrogated by IL-6 overexpression. In conclusion, Mir-26a prolongs skin allograft 
      survival and promotes Tregs expansion in part through inhibition of IL-6 
      expression.

TI  - Long-term functional outcomes upon application of split-thickness skin graft 
      around major joints in HCC (Hung-Chi Chen)-modified Charles' procedure for 
      advanced lymphedema.
PG  - 169-173

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the conventional Charles' procedure for lower-limb lymphedema, 
      full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) or flaps are the preferred treatment for areas 
      around the knee and ankle because of the belief that FTSGs or flaps result in 
      slighter contracture relative to split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs). However, 
      the use of FTSGs or flaps prolongs operation and increases the risk of partial 
      graft loss; should partial graft loss occur, additional grafting is required for 
      remnant defects to avoid significant scarring after secondary healing. The senior 
      author (HCC) thus modified the Charles' procedure and used STSGs around the knee 
      and ankle. The aim of this study was to elucidate the long-term outcomes of STSGs 
      in HCC-modified Charles' procedure, including its attendant complications, such 
      as joint contracture, range-of-motion limitations, and the presence of 
      hypertrophic scars. METHODS: Participants were patients (n = 142) who underwent 
      HCC-modified Charles' procedure and STSGs between 1990 and 2016 for advanced 
      lymphedema; the follow-up was at least 3 years. We detail our modification for 
      improving the take of STSGs in the first operation and the rehabilitation 
      protocol. RESULTS: The active flexion of knee was >90° in 89.4% and 70°-90° in 
      10.6% of patients. The active plantar flexion of ankle was 30° in 90.8% and 
      20°-30° in 9.2% of patients. In Stiefel Grading System, 85.9% were "Excellent," 
      12.0% were "Good," 2.1% were "Fair," and 0 were "Poor." CONCLUSION: STSGs in 
      HCC-modified Charles' procedure yield satisfactory outcomes without joint 
      contracture. Early physiotherapy and the primary take of STSGs are crucial to 
      good functional outcomes.

TI  - Antibody-Mediated Rejection in Sensitized Nonhuman Primates: Modeling Human 
      Biology.
PG  - 1726-38
LID - 10.1111/ajt.13688 [doi]
AB  - We have established a model of sensitization in nonhuman primates and tested two 
      immunosuppressive regimens. Animals underwent fully mismatched skin 
      transplantation, and donor-specific antibody (DSA) response was monitored by flow 
      cross-match. Sensitized animals subsequently underwent kidney transplantation 
      from their skin donor. Immunosuppression included tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and 
      methylprednisolone. Three animals received basiliximab induction; compared with 
      nonsensitized animals, they showed a shorter mean survival time (4.7 ± 3.1 vs. 
      187 ± 88 days). Six animals were treated with T cell depletion (anti-CD4/CD8 
      mAbs), which prolonged survival (mean survival time 21.6 ± 19.0 days). All 
      presensitized animals showed antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). In two of three 
      basiliximab-injected animals, cellular rejection (ACR) was prominent. After T 
      cell depletion, three of six monkeys experienced early acute rejection within 8 
      days with histological evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy and AMR. The 
      remaining three monkeys survived 27-44 days, with mixed AMR and ACR. Most T 
      cell-depleted animals experienced a rebound of DSA that correlated with 
      deteriorating kidney function. We also found an increase in proliferating memory 
      B cells (CD20(+) CD27(+) IgD(-) Ki67(+) ), lymph node follicular helper T cells 
      (ICOS(+) PD-1(hi) CXCR5(+) CD4(+) ), and germinal center (GC) response. Depletion 
      controlled cell-mediated rejection in sensitized nonhuman primates better than 
      basiliximab, yet grafts were rejected with concomitant DSA rise. This model 
      provides an opportunity to test novel desensitization strategies.

AB  - CD11b(+) Gr1(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play critical roles in 
      controlling the processes of tumors, infections, autoimmunity and graft 
      rejection. Immunosuppressive drug rapamycin (RPM), targeting on the key cellular 
      metabolism molecule mTOR, is currently used in clinics to treat patients with 
      allo-grafts, autoimmune diseases and tumors. However, the effect of RPM on MDSCs 
      has not been studied. RPM significantly decreases the cell number and the 
      immunosuppressive ability on T cells of CD11b(+) Ly6C(high) monocytic MDSCs 
      (M-MDSCs) in both allo-grafts-transplanted and tumor-bearing mice respectively. 
      Mice with a myeloid-specific deletion of mTOR have poor M-MDSCs after grafting 
      with allo-skin tissue or a tumor. Grafting of allo-skin or tumors significantly 
      activates glycolysis pathways in myeloid precursor cells in bone marrow, which is 
      inhibited by RPM or mTOR deletion. 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), an inhibitor of the 
      glycolytic pathway, inhibits M-MDSC differentiation from precursors, while 
      enhancing glycolysis by metformin significantly rescues the RPM-caused deficiency 
      of M-MDSCs. Therefore, we offer evidence supporting that mTOR is an intrinsic 
      factor essential for the differentiation and immunosuppressive function of 
      M-MDSCs and that these metabolism-relevant medicines may impact MDSCs-mediated 
      immunosuppression or immune tolerance induction, which is of considerable 
      clinical importance in treating graft rejection, autoimmune diseases and cancers.

TI  - Interferon-γ derived from cytotoxic lymphocytes directly enhances their motility 
      and cytotoxicity.
PG  - e2836
LID - 10.1038/cddis.2017.67 [doi]
AB  - Interferon gamma (IFNγ) is a key moderator of cell-mediated immunity with 
      diverse, mainly pro-inflammatory actions on immunocytes and target tissue. Recent 
      studies have shown it may enhance anti-tumor and antiviral effects of CD8 T 
      cells. Here we investigate the mechanisms by which IFNγ mediates CD8 T-cell 
      cytotoxic function. We show that in vivo, antigen-specific CD8 T cells that 
      produce INFγ are necessary to effect rejection of skin grafts expressing OVA as a 
      transgene in keratinocytes. The ability of CD8 T cells to produce IFNγ enhanced 
      their ability to migrate to the site of antigen-presenting skin cells. By in vivo 
      imaging, we show that CTL motility, particularly speed, during graft rejection 
      was enhanced by locally available IFNγ. We then used a reductionist two-cell 
      model of CTL effectors and keratinocyte targets to investigate the effects of 
      locally available (paracrine) and CTL-producing (autocrine) IFNγ on the motility 
      behavior and killing ability of the CTL. Using live-cell imaging by prolonged 
      time-lapse microscopy of primary effector CD8 T cells and antigen-expressing 
      primary keratinocyte targets, we show that CD8 T-cell cytotoxic function and 
      motility is enhanced by locally available IFNγ. Conversely, deprivation of either 
      autocrine or paracrine IFNγ, or blockade of IFNγ signaling to CTL markedly 
      reduced their cytotoxic function, their kinematics, and effector cell survival. 
      We conclude that in vitro and in vivo, autocrine production of IFNγ by CTL 
      enhances their motility and promotes killing of primary target keratinocytes. The 
      absolute need for local IFNγ to enable cytotoxic CD8 T-cell function is of 
      significance for immunotherapy for chronic viral infection and for cancer.

TI  - Indications and Limitations of Bilayer Wound Matrix-Based Lower Extremity 
      Reconstruction: A Multidisciplinary Case-Control Study of 191 Wounds.
PG  - 813-822
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000006609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the efficacy of newer skin substitute scaffolds 
      to reconstruct complex lower extremity wounds. The investigators present a 
      multihospital experience of reconstructive surgeons utilizing collagen-GAG 
      bilayer wound matrix in lower extremity soft-tissue reconstruction with the goals 
      to (1) characterize a suitable patient population, (2) categorize failures to 
      optimize patient selection, and (3) determine wound factors affecting success. 
      METHODS: Subjects underwent collagen-GAG-based lower extremity wound 
      reconstruction from May of 2010 to June of 2017. The primary outcome variable was 
      180-day graft success, defined as eventual split-thickness skin grafting after 
      bilayer wound matrix application; failure was defined as inadequate wound bed for 
      split-thickness skin grafting, requirement for vascularized tissue transfer, or 
      eventual amputation. Eligible subjects had at least one lower extremity wound and 
      were at least 18 years old. Exclusion criteria included third-degree burn wounds 
      or failure to follow up for at least 60 days postoperatively. Predictor variables 
      included demographics, medical comorbidities, perioperative characteristics, 
      postoperative complications, and cost-related data for each hospitalization. 
      RESULTS: There were 147 subjects with 191 wounds. Mean patient age was 60.1 years 
      (range, 21.0 to 95.6 years), and mean body mass index was 30.5 kg/m (range, 14.4 
      to 64.7 kg/m). Average wound size was 73.1 ± 137.7 cm, with 49.0 percent of 
      subjects receiving adjunct postoperative negative-pressure wound therapy. Seventy 
      percent of wounds were successfully healed at 180 days. Most were localized 
      between the knee and ankle (50.8 percent) or foot (46.1 percent). Tendon exposure 
      (p < 0.05), bone exposure (p < 0.01), and bone excision (p < 0.04) were 
      associated with reconstructive failure. CONCLUSIONS: The authors present the 
      largest reported multihospital, multidisciplinary experience with collagen-GAG 
      wound matrix for lower extremity reconstruction. Tendon and/or bone exposure and 
      socioeconomic factors were associated with failure. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Risk, III.

TI  - IL-2 therapy preferentially expands adoptively transferred donor-specific Tregs 
      improving skin allograft survival.
PG  - 2092-2100
LID - 10.1111/ajt.15306 [doi]
AB  - Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have unique immunosuppressive properties and are 
      essential to ensure effective immunoregulation. In animal models, Tregs have been 
      shown to prevent autoimmune disorders and establish transplantation tolerance. 
      Therefore, the prospect of harnessing Tregs, either by increasing their frequency 
      or by conferring allospecificity, has prompted a growing interest in the 
      development of immunotherapies. Here, employing a well-established skin 
      transplant model with a single major histocompatibility complex mismatch, we 
      compared the therapeutic efficacy of adoptively transfer Treg with or without 
      donor specificity and the administration of IL-2 to promote in vivo expansion of 
      Treg. We showed that IL-2 treatment preferentially enhances the proliferation of 
      the allospecific Tregs adoptively transferred in an antigen-dependent manner. In 
      addition, donor-specific Tregs significantly increased the expression of 
      regulatory-related marker, such as CTLA4 and inducible costimulator (ICOS), in 
      the skin allograft and draining lymph nodes compared to endogenous and polyclonal 
      transferred Tregs. Importantly, by combining IL-2 with donor-specific Tregs, but 
      not with polyclonal Tregs, a synergistic effect in prolonging skin allograft 
      survival was observed. Altogether, our data suggest that this combination therapy 
      could provide the appropriate conditions to enhance the immunoregulation of 
      alloimmune responses in clinical transplantation.

TI  - Negative-pressure wound dressings to secure split-thickness skin grafts in the 
      perineum.

AB  - Several researches have shown that negative-pressure wound dressings can secure 
      split-thickness skin grafts and improve graft survival. However, in anatomically 
      difficult body regions such as the perineum it is questionable whether these 
      dressings have similar beneficial effects. In this study, we evaluated the 
      effects of negative-pressure wound dressings on split-thickness skin grafts in 
      the perineum by comparing wound healing rate and complication rate with that of 
      tie-over dressings. A retrospective chart review was performed for the patients 
      who underwent a split-thickness skin graft to reconstruct perineal skin defects 
      between January 2007 and December 2011. After grafting, the surgeon selected 
      patients to receive either a negative-pressure dressing or a tie-over dressing. 
      In both groups, the initial dressing was left unchanged for 5 days, then changed 
      to conventional wet gauze dressing. Graft success was assessed 2 weeks after 
      surgery by a single clinician. A total of 26 patients were included in this 
      study. The mean age was 56·6 years and the mean wound size was 273·1 cm(2). Among 
      them 14 received negative-pressure dressings and 12 received tie-over dressings. 
      Negative-pressure dressing group had higher graft taken rate (P = 0·036) and took 
      shorter time to complete healing (P = 0·01) than tie-over dressing group. The 
      patients with negative-pressure dressings had a higher rate of graft success and 
      shorter time to complete healing, which has statistical significance. 
      Negative-pressure wound dressing can be a good option for effective management of 
      skin grafts in the perineum.

TI  - The Role of T Cell Costimulation via DNAM-1 in Kidney Transplantation.
PG  - e0147951

LID - e0147951
AB  - DNAX accessory protein-1 (DNAM-1, CD226) is a co-stimulatory and adhesion 
      molecule expressed mainly by natural killer cells and T cells. DNAM-1 and its two 
      ligands CD112 and CD155 are important in graft-versus-host disease, but their 
      role in solid organ transplantation is largely unknown. We investigated the 
      relevance of this pathway in a mouse kidney transplantation model. CD112 and 
      CD155 are constitutively expressed on renal tubular cells and strongly 
      upregulated in acutely rejected renal allografts. In vitro DNAM-1 blockade during 
      allogeneic priming reduced the allospecific T cell response but not the 
      allospecific cytotoxicity against renal tubular epithelial cells. Accordingly, 
      absence of DNAM-1 in recipient mice or absence of CD112 or CD155 in the kidney 
      allograft did not significantly influence renal function and severity of 
      rejection after transplantation, but led to a higher incidence of infarcts in 
      CD112 and CD155 deficient kidney allografts. Thus, DNAM-1 blockade is not 
      effective in preventing transplant rejection. Despite of being highly expressed, 
      CD112 and CD155 do not appear to play a major immunogenic role in kidney 
      transplantation. Considering the high incidence of renal infarcts in CD112 and 
      CD155 deficient grafts, blocking these molecules might be detrimental.

TI  - Enhanced Requirement for TNFR2 in Graft Rejection Mediated by Low-Affinity Memory 
      CD8+ T Cells during Heterologous Immunity.
PG  - 2009-15
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1502680 [doi]
AB  - The affinity of a TCR binding to peptide:MHC profoundly impacts the phenotype and 
      function of effector and memory cell differentiation. Little is known about the 
      effect of low-affinity priming on memory cell generation and function, which is 
      particularly important in heterologous immunity, when microbe-specific T cells 
      cross-react with allogeneic Ag and mediate graft rejection. We found that 
      low-affinity-primed memory CD8(+) T cells produced high levels of TNF ex vivo in 
      response to heterologous rechallenge compared with high-affinity-primed memory T 
      cells. Low-affinity secondary effectors significantly upregulated TNFR2 on the 
      cell surface and contained a higher frequency of TNFR2(hi) proliferating cells. 
      Low-affinity-primed secondary effectors concurrently downregulated TNF 
      production. Importantly, blockade of TNFR2 attenuated graft rejection in low- but 
      not high-affinity-primed animals. These data establish a functional connection 
      between TNF signaling and TCR-priming affinity and have implications for the 
      immunomodulation of pathogenic T cell responses during transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The lack of noninvasive biomarkers for graft rejection remains a 
      challenge for the accurate monitoring of vascularized composite allotransplants. 
      Viral vector-mediated gene transfer is a promising method for preventing graft 
      rejection. In this study, we aimed to establish the expression profile of 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) in skin flap allotransplantation, with or without gene 
      transfer, and determine the potential role of several miRNAs as biomarkers of 
      acute rejection and immune tolerance. METHODS: An abdominal epigastric flap was 
      transplanted from SD (RT1(a)) to Wistar rats (RT1A(u)). The adenoviral 
      interleukin 10 (vIL-10) gene was transferred to the experimental group via flap 
      pedicle injection. Postoperatively, flap appearance, hematoxylin and eosin 
      staining, immunohistochemical staining, and miRNA expression analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: The viral IL-10 gene-treated group showed improved flap 
      survival and reduced acute rejection response compared with the control group. On 
      postoperative day 7, IL-10 expression in the flap was identified using 
      immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of 
      miR-191a, miR-31a, miR-16, and miR-3473 was upregulated in the skin tissue, and 
      that of miR-484, miR-132, miR-139, miR-150, and miR-6216 was upregulated in the 
      serum. CONCLUSION: AV IL-10 gene transfer could be an effective immunosuppressive 
      strategy for the prevention of skin flap allograft rejection. Additionally, some 
      miRNAs were upregulated in the experimental group, serving as potential 
      biomarkers of immune tolerance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. Although 
      the literature provides a great deal of information on the recurrences of basal 
      cell carcinoma, studies about these indices addressing only the cases in which 
      flaps and/or grafts have been performed for surgical reconstruction of the 
      excision of this tumor are still lacking. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate rates of 
      recurrence of basal cell carcinoma submitted to conventional surgery with 
      pre-established margins and reconstruction by flaps or grafts. METHODS: A 
      retrospective and observational study was performed through the analysis of 109 
      patients, who met inclusion criteria with 116 basal cell carcinomas submitted to 
      conventional surgery and pre-established safety margins, requiring reconstruction 
      through a graft or cutaneous flap. This work was performed the small surgeries 
      sector of Dermatology of the Specialty Outpatient Clinic of the University 
      Hospital of the State University of Londrina, between January 1, 2011 and 
      December 31, 2015. The following data were collected and inserted in an Excel 
      worksheet: name, registration number of the hospital patient, sex, age, tumor 
      location, histopathological type of BCC, procedure performed (type of flap and/or 
      graft), follow-up time, recurrence. RESULTS: Of the 116 procedures, there were 
      recurrences in 3 cases (2.6%) that were located in the nasal region and related 
      to sclerodermiform or micronodular histological types. STUDY LIMITATIONS: 
      Retrospective nature of the study. CONCLUSION: The present study of the 
      dermatology department of this university hospital showed a low rate of 
      recurrence of basal cell carcinoma in cases where flaps and/or grafts were used 
      in the surgical reconstruction.

TI  - MMP3 Is a Non-invasive Biomarker of Rejection in Skin-Bearing Vascularized 
      Composite Allotransplantation: A Multicenter Validation Study.
PG  - 2771
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02771 [doi]
LID - 2771
AB  - Background: There is unmet need for non-invasive immunomonitoring to improve 
      diagnosis and treatment of acute rejection in vascularized composite 
      allotransplantation (VCA). Circulating matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) was 
      described as a candidate non-invasive biomarker to predict treatment response to 
      acute rejection in clinical VCA. However, larger validation studies are yet to be 
      reported to allow for more definitive conclusions. Methods: We retrospectively 
      measured MMP3 levels using ELISA in a total of 140 longitudinal serum samples 
      from six internal and three external face transplant recipients, as well as three 
      internal and seven external upper extremity transplant recipients. The control 
      groups comprised serum samples from 36 kidney transplant recipients, 14 healthy 
      controls, and 38 patients with autoimmune skin disease. A linear mixed model was 
      used to study the effect of rejection state (pre-transplant, no-rejection, 
      non-severe rejection (NSR), and severe rejection) on MMP3 levels. Results: In 
      VCA, MMP3 levels increased significantly (p < 0.001) between pre- and 
      post-transplant no-rejection states. A further increase occurred during severe 
      rejection (p < 0.001), while there was no difference in MMP3 levels between 
      non-severe and no-rejection episodes. A threshold of 5-fold increase from 
      pre-transplant levels could discriminate severe from NSR with 76% sensitivity and 
      81% specificity (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.65-0.92, p < 0.001). In kidney 
      transplantation, the MMP3 levels were significantly (p < 0.001) elevated during 
      antibody-mediated rejection but not during T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) (p = 
      0.547). MMP3 levels in healthy controls and autoimmune skin disease patients were 
      comparable with either pre-transplant or no-rejection/NSR episodes of VCA 
      patients. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that serum MMP3 protein 
      is a promising marker for stratifying patients according to severity of 
      rejection, complementary to biopsy findings.

TI  - Association of Bolster Duration With Uptake Rates of Fibula Donor Site Skin 
      Grafts.
PG  - 537-542
LID - 10.1001/jamaoto.2020.0160 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The fibula free flap donor site is associated with both short-term 
      and long-term morbidity. Split-thickness skin graft (STSG) loss can lead to long 
      delays in donor site healing and is associated with significant adverse sequelae. 
      Patients may experience initial good STSG uptake after bolster removal but may 
      have subsequent partial or total loss related to contact pressure or shearing. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine if increased duration of bolster use is associated with 
      increased STSG uptake rates following fibula free flap reconstruction. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included patients 18 
      years and older undergoing fibula free flap reconstruction following head and 
      neck extirpative surgery at a tertiary care academic medical center from May 2013 
      to March 2019. The donor sites were photographed 4 weeks postoperatively, and 
      areas of graft uptake were measured using image processing software. The baseline 
      demographic, comorbidity, and operative characteristics were also collected. 
      INTERVENTIONS: A fine mesh gauze with 3% bismuth tribromophenate and petrolatum 
      blend bolster was sutured over leg STSGs placed on fibula free flap donor sites 
      intraoperatively, and the ankle and lower leg were immobilized for 5 days in a 
      plaster splint. Bolsters were either removed on postoperative day 5 or 14. 
      Thereafter, the STSGs were covered with a petroleum and bismuth gauze and a 
      cotton dressing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of donor site infection and 
      STSG percentage uptake at 4 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 42 included patients, 31 (74%) 
      were male, and the mean (SD) age was 62.1 (13.1) years. A total of 20 patients 
      were included in the 5-day group, and 22 were included in the 14-day group. The 
      14-day bolster group had a higher mean percentage skin graft uptake rate compared 
      with the 5-day bolster duration group (77.5% vs 59.9%), with an effect size of 
      -0.632 (95% CI, -1.260 to -0.004). Patients with Adult Comorbidity Evalution-27 
      scores of 3 had poorer rates of STSG uptake compared with patients with Adult 
      Comorbidity Evalution-27 scores of 0 to 2 (65.9% vs 82.9%), with an effect size 
      of 0.599 (95% CI, -0.191 to 1.389). No donor site infections were noted in either 
      group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Fourteen-day bolster application to the fibula 
      free flap donor site was associated with better STSG uptake rates than 5-day 
      bolster application.

PG  - 2725

LID - 2725
AB  - Galectin-1 (Gal-1) is required for the development of B cells in the bone marrow 
      (BM), however very little is known about the contribution of Gal-1 to the 
      development of B cell regulatory function. Here, we report an important role for 
      Gal-1 in the induction of B cells regulatory function. Mice deficient of Gal-1 
      (Gal-1(-/-)) showed significant loss of Transitional-2 (T2) B cells, previously 
      reported to include IL-10(+) regulatory B cells. Gal-1(-/-) B cells stimulated in 
      vitro via CD40 molecules have impaired IL-10 and Tim-1 expression, the latter 
      reported to be required for IL-10 production in regulatory B cells, and increased 
      TNF-α expression compared to wild type (WT) B cells. Unlike their WT 
      counterparts, T2 and T1 Gal-1(-/-) B cells did not suppress TNF-α expression by 
      CD4(+) T cells activated in vitro with allogenic DCs (allo-DCs), nor were they 
      suppressive in vivo, being unable to delay MHC-class I mismatched skin allograft 
      rejection following adoptive transfer. Moreover, T cells stimulated with allo-DCs 
      show an increase in their survival when co-cultured with Gal-1(-/-) T2 and MZ B 
      cells compared to WT T2 and MZ B cells. Collectively, these data suggest that 
      Gal-1 contributes to the induction of B cells regulatory function.

AB  - Calcitriol, a metabolite of vitamin D, is often used in osteoporosis clinics. 
      However, the material has other bioactivities; for example, it accelerates 
      angiogenesis, has anti-inflammatory properties, and inhibits oxidative stress. We 
      investigated the effects of calcitriol in a random skin flap rat model. 
      "McFarlane flap" models were established in 84 male Sprague Dawley rats, divided 
      into two groups. One group received intraperitoneal injections of calcitriol 
      (2 μg/kg/day) whereas control rats received intraperitoneal injections of saline. 
      The percentage flap survival area and tissue water content were measured 7 days 
      later, which showed that calcitriol improved flap survival area and reduced 
      tissue edema. It also increased the mean vessel density and upregulated levels of 
      VEGF mRNA/protein, both of which promote flap angiogenesis. Moreover, it 
      decreased leukocyte and macrophage infiltration, reduced the inflammatory 
      proteins IL1β and IL6, increased SOD activity, decreased MDA content, and 
      upregulated the level of autophagy. Overall, our results suggest that calcitriol 
      promotes skin flap survival by accelerating angiogenesis, having 
      anti-inflammatory effects, reducing oxidative stress, and promoting autophagy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin engraftment of intraoral defects is known to be inconsistent due 
      to mobility of the oral structure, uneven wounds, and accumulation of saliva 
      under the skin graft. To improve the success rate of oral skin graft, we proposed 
      a novel and simple dressing technique for intraoral skin graft to control saliva 
      accumulation, in comparison with the conventional bolster dressing. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively reviewed 31 patients reconstructed with skin graft in their 
      intraoral defect. The patients were divided into two groups; conventional bolster 
      group (n = 21) and modified bolster group (n = 10). In the modified bolster 
      group, a polyvinyl alcohol sponge was designed to fit the skin graft and a 
      suction drain was inserted with tagging suture to apply continuous suction. We 
      analyzed the success rate, the size of the skin grafts and clinical variables of 
      each method. RESULTS: The overall success rate of oral skin graft was not 
      different between the two groups (90.0 and 90.5%). However, partial necrosis in 
      the engrafted skin was observed frequently in the control group (57.1% versus 
      20.0%). The relative engrafted area was significantly higher in the modified 
      bolster group (55.0 ± 11.6% versus 23.0 ± 18.7%, p = 0.015). The duration of 
      bolster dressing and the time to start an oral diet were shorter in the modified 
      bolster group. CONCLUSIONS: Our modified method could be easily applied for 
      removing saliva accumulation under a skin graft and for enhancing skin 
      engraftment of an oral cavity wound.

AB  - Achieving long-term allograft survival without continuous global 
      immunosuppression is highly desirable because constant immunosuppression causes 
      severe side effects. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been utilized to 
      treat numerous diseases for centuries. To seek novel immunosuppressive agents, we 
      investigated several Chinese herbal formulas that have been shown to be effective 
      in treating autoimmune diseases. C57BL/6 mice were transplanted with a skin graft 
      from Balb/C donors and treated orally with the TCM. IL-12-expressing dendritic 
      cells and CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs were quantified by flow cytometer while intragraft 
      IL-12 gene expression was measured by real-time PCR. Here we identified a unique 
      TCM, San Si formula, which contains three herbs: Fructus corni (FC), Fructus 
      ligustri lucidi (FLL) and Semen cuscutae (SC). We found that either SC or FC, but 
      not FLL, significantly prolonged skin allograft survival while SC plus FC or San 
      Si formula further delayed allograft rejection compared to SC or FC alone. SC and 
      FC, which did not contain cyclosporine and rapamycin, reduced graft-infiltrating 
      T cells and suppressed their proliferation. Importantly, it was SC, but not FC, 
      that induced CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs in recipients. Tregs induced by SC were also more 
      potent in suppression. In contrast, FC repressed both intracellular IL-12 
      expression by intragraft DCs and IFNγ expression by graft-infiltrating T cells. 
      Moreover, FC inhibited intragraft IL-12 gene expression. Depleting Tregs and 
      providing exogenous IL-12 completely reversed allograft survival induced by SC 
      plus FC. Thus, SC and FC synergistically suppress allograft rejection via 
      distinct mechanisms.

      Lymphocytes Following Hand Transplantation.
PG  - 1502-1509
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000003535 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: T lymphocyte-mediated acute rejection is a significant complication 
      following solid organ transplantation. Standard methods of monitoring for acute 
      rejection rely on assessing histological tissue damage but do not define the 
      immunopathogenesis. Additionally, current therapies for rejection broadly blunt 
      cellular immunity, creating a high risk for opportunistic infections. There is, 
      therefore, a need to better understand the process of acute cellular rejection to 
      help develop improved prognostic tests and narrowly targeted therapies. METHODS: 
      Through next-generation sequencing, we characterized and compared the clonal 
      T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of graft-infiltrating lymphocytes (GILs) and 
      blood-derived lymphocytes from a hand transplant recipient over 420 days 
      following transplantation. We also tracked the TCR clonal persistence and V beta 
      (BV) gene usage, evaluating overlap between these 2 compartments. RESULTS: TCR 
      repertoires of blood and GIL populations remained distinct throughout the 
      sampling period, and differential BV usage was consistently seen between these 
      compartments. GIL TCR clones persisted over time and were seen in only limited 
      frequency in the blood T-lymphocyte populations. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that 
      blood monitoring of TCR clones does not reveal the pathogenic process of acute 
      cellular rejection in transplanted tissue. GILs show clonal persistence with 
      biased BV usage, suggesting that tissue TCR clonal monitoring could be useful, 
      although a deeper understanding is necessary to prognosticate rejection based on 
      TCR clonal repertoires. Finally, the distinct TCR BV usage bias in GILs raises 
      the possibility for prevention and therapy of acute cellular rejection based on 
      targeting of specific TCR clones.

PG  - 2805-20
LID - 84577 [pii]

AB  - The immune response against transplanted allografts is one of the most potent 
      reactions mounted by the immune system. The acute rejection response has been 
      attributed to donor dendritic cells (DCs), which migrate to recipient lymphoid 
      tissues and directly activate alloreactive T cells against donor MHC molecules. 
      Here, using a murine heart transplant model, we determined that only a small 
      number of donor DCs reach lymphoid tissues and investigated how this limited 
      population of donor DCs efficiently initiates the alloreactive T cell response 
      that causes acute rejection. In our mouse model, efficient passage of donor MHC 
      molecules to recipient conventional DCs (cDCs) was dependent on the transfer of 
      extracellular vesicles (EVs) from donor DCs that migrated from the graft to 
      lymphoid tissues. These EVs shared characteristics with exosomes and were 
      internalized or remained attached to the recipient cDCs. Recipient cDCs that 
      acquired exosomes became activated and triggered full activation of alloreactive 
      T cells. Depletion of recipient cDCs after cardiac transplantation drastically 
      decreased presentation of donor MHC molecules to directly alloreactive T cells 
      and delayed graft rejection in mice. These findings support a key role for 
      transfer of donor EVs in the generation of allograft-targeting immune responses 
      and suggest that interrupting this process has potential to dampen the immune 
      response to allografts.

TI  - T-regulatory cell treatment prevents chronic rejection of heart allografts in a 
      murine mixed chimerism model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mixed chimerism approach induces donor-specific tolerance in both 
      pre-clinical models and clinical pilot trials. However, chronic rejection of 
      heart allografts and acute rejection of skin allografts were observed in some 
      chimeric animals despite persistent hematopoietic chimerism and tolerance toward 
      donor antigens in vitro. We tested whether additional cell therapy with 
      regulatory T cells (Tregs) is able to induce full immunologic tolerance and 
      prevent chronic rejection. METHODS: We recently developed a murine "Treg bone 
      marrow (BM) transplantation (BMT) protocol" that is devoid of cytoreductive 
      recipient pre-treatment. The protocol consists of a moderate dose of fully 
      mismatched allogeneic donor BM under costimulation blockade, together with 
      polyclonal recipient Tregs and rapamycin. Control groups received BMT under 
      non-myeloablative irradiation and costimulation blockade without Treg therapy. 
      Multilineage chimerism was followed by flow cytometry, and tolerance was assessed 
      by donor-specific skin and heart allografts. RESULTS: Durable multilineage 
      chimerism and long-term donor skin and heart allograft survival were successfully 
      achieved with both protocols. Notably, histologic examination of heart allografts 
      at the end of follow-up revealed that chronic rejection is prevented only in 
      chimeras induced with the Treg protocol. CONCLUSIONS: In a mouse model of mixed 
      chimerism, additional Treg treatment at the time of BMT prevents chronic 
      rejection of heart allografts. As the Treg-chimerism protocol also obviates the 
      need for cytoreductive recipient treatment it improves both efficacy and safety 
      over previous non-myeloablative mixed chimerism regimens. These results may 
      significantly impact the development of protocols for tolerance induction in 
      cardiac transplantation.

TI  - Interleukin 17 (IL-17)-Induced Mesenchymal Stem Cells Prolong the Survival of 
      Allogeneic Skin Grafts.
PG  - 615-621
LID - 10.12659/AOT.909381 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential of self-renewal and 
      multi-differentiation and have a wide application prospect in organ 
      transplantation for the effect of inducing immune tolerance. It has found that 
      interleukin 17 (IL-17) could enhance the inhibition effect of MSCs on T cell 
      proliferation and increase the immunosuppressive effect of MSCs. In this study, 
      we aimed to investigate the effect of IL-17-induced MSCs on allograft survival 
      time after transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS BMSCs were characterized by 
      differential staining. The allogenic skin transplantations were performed and the 
      BMSCs pre-treated by IL-17 were injected. To assess the immunosuppressive 
      function of IL-17-induced BMSCs, the morphology of the grafts, the homing ability 
      of the BMSCs, and the survival time of the grafts were analyzed. RESULTS BMSCs 
      from BALB/c have multidirectional differentiation potential to differentiate into 
      osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineage cells. IL-17-induced BMSCs 
      prolonged the survival time of allogeneic skin grafts dramatically. We found that 
      there were more labeled MSCs in the skin grafts, and the Treg subpopulations 
      percentage, IL-10, and TGF-β were significantly increased, while the IFN-γ level 
      was decreased compared to the control group and MSCs group. In conclusion, IL-17 
      can enhance the homing ability of MSCs and regulate the immunosuppressive 
      function of MSC. CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate that IL-17 plays the crucial 
      role in MSC homing behaviors and promotes immunosuppression of MSCs during 
      transplantation procedures, suggesting that IL-17-pre-treated MSCs have potential 
      to prolong graft survival and reduce transplant rejection.

TI  - Effects of resveratrol on Th17 cell-related immune responses under 
      tacrolimus-based immunosuppression.
PG  - 54
LID - 10.1186/s12906-019-2464-1 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported that tacrolimus (Tac) does not decrease T 
      helper 17 cells (Th17) response in kidney transplantation. In this study, we 
      evaluated whether Resveratrol (Resv) has immunosuppressive effects by decreasing 
      Th17 responses in Tac-based immunosuppression. METHODS: We investigated the 
      effects of Resv under Tac-treatment conditions, on CD4(+) T cell differentiation 
      to Th17 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and proliferation of 
      CD4(+) T cells co-cultured with human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells 
      (HRPTEpiCs). The effects of Resv on Th17 cells were tested in the murine skin 
      transplant model. RESULTS: In PBMCs, Tac did not but combination of Tac and Resv 
      further suppressed Th17 immune response. In the co-culture study, combination of 
      Resv to Tac significantly decreased HRPTEpiC-induced T cell proliferation 
      compared to Tac alone. Resv treatment in the Jurkat cell induced the expression 
      of AMP-activated protein kinase and suppressed the expression of mammalian target 
      of rapamycin (mTOR), suggesting blocking Th17 pathway by Resv. In the murine skin 
      transplant model, combination of Resv to Tac significantly prolonged skin graft 
      survival accompanied by the suppression of Th17 cells, compared to either the 
      Tac-alone or control groups. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that 
      Resv provides additional immunosuppressive effects to Tac by suppressing effector 
      CD4(+) T cells, especially Th17 cells, in the transplantation setting.

AB  - In this study, we showed that aly/aly mice, which are devoid of lymph nodes and 
      Peyer's patches, acutely rejected fully allogeneic skin and heart grafts. They 
      mounted potent inflammatory direct alloresponses but failed to develop indirect 
      alloreactivity after transplantation. Remarkably, skin allografts also were 
      rejected acutely by splenectomized aly/aly (aly/aly-spl(-)) mice devoid of all 
      secondary lymphoid organs. In these recipients, the rejection was mediated by 
      alloreactive CD8(+) T cells presumably primed in the bone marrow. In contrast, 
      cardiac transplants were not rejected by aly/aly-spl(-) mice. Actually, 
      aly/aly-spl(-) mice that spontaneously accepted a heart allotransplant and 
      displayed donor-specific tolerance also accepted skin grafts from the same, but 
      not a third-party, donor via a mechanism involving CD4(+) regulatory T cells 
      producing IL-10 cytokine. Therefore, direct priming of alloreactive T cells, as 
      well as rejection and regulatory tolerance of allogeneic transplants, can occur 
      in recipient mice lacking secondary lymphoid organs.

TI  - Induction of alloantigen-specific CD4+ T regulatory Type 1 cells by alloantigen 
      immunization and ultraviolet-B irradiation: a pilot study in murine 
      transplantation models with skin and cardiac allografts.
PG  - 519-36
LID - 10.12659/AOT.890890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of ultraviolet (UV)-B irradiation after alloantigen 
      immunization is unknown because previous studies focused on UV-B irradiation 
      before immunization. Here, we investigated immunosuppressive effects induced by 
      UV-B irradiation after immunization, and examined the phenotype of induced 
      regulatory T cells and the possible mechanism of induction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      B6 mice (H-2(b)) were intravenously immunized by splenocytes from CBF1 mice 
      (H-2(b/d)). One week after alloantigen immunization, B6 mice received high-dose 
      UV-B irradiation (40 kJ/m(2)). Four weeks after UV-B irradiation, proliferation 
      assays (n=4, in each), transplantations with skin or cardiac allografts (n=5, in 
      each), cytokines in mixed lymphocyte culture (n=6, in each), and adoptive 
      transfer of CD4(+) T cells to naïve B6 mice (n=5, in each) were performed. Mice 
      were divided into 4 groups: untreated control, immunized control, UV-irradiated 
      control, and an immunized and UV-irradiated group. B6C3F1 mice (H-2(b/k)) were 
      used as irrelevant alloantigen with immunization controls. Anti-IL-10 monoclonal 
      antibody was used to block IL-10 before and after UV-B irradiation. RESULTS: 
      Immune responses against the immunizing antigen were markedly suppressed in 
      immunized and UV-irradiated mice in an alloantigen-specific manner. Surprisingly, 
      CD4(+) T cells from immunized and UV-irradiated mice produced significantly 
      larger amounts of IL-10, in an alloantigen-specific manner. Moreover, 
      alloantigen-specific immunosuppression via CD4(+) regulatory T cells was 
      transferable to naïve B6 mice. IL-10 blocking clearly abrogated 
      alloantigen-specific immunosuppression, indicating that UV-B irradiation evoked T 
      regulatory type 1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates for the first time 
      that immunization and UV irradiation induces alloantigen-specific CD4(+) T 
      regulatory type 1 cells, and that IL-10 plays an important role for this 
      induction.

TI  - CD96 expression determines the inflammatory potential of IL-9-producing Th9 
      cells.
PG  - E2940-E2949
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1708329115 [doi]
AB  - Recent findings demonstrated proinflammatory functions of interleukin 
      (IL)-9-producing T helper type (Th) 9 cells in the pathogenesis of intestinal 
      bowel diseases (IBDs). However, also antiinflammatory properties have been 
      ascribed to Th9 cells, pointing to a functional heterogeneity. To dissect the 
      specific expression pattern and, especially, diversity of murine antigen-specific 
      Th9 cells, we applied single cell transcription profiling. Th9 cells displayed 
      reduced expression of typical activation markers, such as Cd40 ligand and Cd96, 
      whereas expression of Cd25 and Cd83 was increased compared with other Th subsets. 
      Importantly, we identified two subsets of Th9 cells differing above all in their 
      CD96 expression. The heterogeneous CD96 expression was specific for Th9 cells and 
      not observed for other Th subtypes, such as Th1 cells. Lower CD96 expression was 
      also observed in human IL-9(+) compared with IFN-γ(+) T cells. Although Il9 was 
      highly transcribed by all Th9 cells, IL-9 mRNA and protein expression was 
      increased in CD96(low) cells. Transfer of CD96(low) Th9 cells into recombination 
      activating gene 1-deficient (Rag1(-/-) ) mice caused severe weight loss, 
      intestinal and colonic inflammation, and destruction of allogeneic skin grafts 
      and thus showed high inflammatory potential. This was associated with their 
      expansion and tissue accumulation. Contrastingly, CD96(high) Th9 cells did not 
      cause colitis and showed reduced expansion and migratory potential. Blockade of 
      CD96 completely restored the expansion and inflammatory properties of CD96(high) 
      Th9 cells. Collectively, our data suggest an inhibitory role for the cosignaling 
      receptor CD96 in Th9 cells, raising new opportunities in the treatment of 
      IL-9-associated inflammations such as IBD.

TI  - Topical and Systemic Effects of N-acetyl Cysteine on Wound Healing in a Diabetic 
      Rat Model.
PG  - 91-96
LID - WNDS20190214-2 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the effects of topical and systemic N-acetyl 
      cysteine (NAC) treatment on wound healing in a diabetic rat model. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A total of 48 male Wistar Albino rats were randomly divided into 4 
      groups of 12. Diabetes was induced with an intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg 
      streptozotocin. A 2-cm x 1-cm full-thickness wound was created on the back of 
      each animal. In group 1 (control) and group 3 (systemic NAC), the wounds were 
      closed with 0.9% sodium chloride-treated sterile gauze. In group 2 (topical NAC) 
      and group 4 (topical + systemic NAC), the wounds were closed with sterile gauze 
      treated with 3 mL (300 mg) of NAC. The animals in groups 3 and 4 were 
      administered 200 mg/kg of NAC once daily through an orogastric tube. On days 1 
      and 14, the wounded areas were measured. Tissue and blood samples were taken on 
      day 14 for histopathological and biochemical examination. RESULTS: On day 14, the 
      wounded area in groups 2, 3, and 4 was found to be smaller than in group 1 
      (control). Histopathologically, epithelialization and fibrosis scores were 
      significantly lower, whereas the inflammation score was higher in group 1 than in 
      the other groups. Tissue oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, 
      fluorescent oxidation products, total oxidative stress) were higher in the 
      control group than in the other groups. In groups 3 and 4 (which received 
      systemic NAC), the oxidative stress parameters in serum samples were lower than 
      those of the control group and group 2. Serum sulphydryl levels were the lowest 
      in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that both topical and 
      systemic administration of NAC improved wound healing in a diabetic rat model. 
      This effect of NAC may be related to its antioxidant properties since a reduction 
      in oxidative stress parameters in both tissue and serum were shown in the present 
      study.

TI  - Outcome of full-thickness skin grafts used to close skin defects involving the 
      distal aspects of the limbs in cats and dogs: 52 cases (2005-2012).
PG  - 1042-7
LID - 10.2460/javma.247.9.1042 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcome of full-thickness skin grafts used to close 
      skin defects involving the distal aspects of the limbs in cats and dogs and 
      identify factors associated with outcome. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. 
      ANIMALS: 20 cats and 32 dogs with a skin defect involving the distal aspect of a 
      limb that received 58 full-thickness skin grafts between 2005 and 2012. 
      PROCEDURES: Data regarding patient signalment, location and cause of the skin 
      defect, surgical and anesthetic duration, and postoperative bandaging protocol 
      were obtained from the medical records. Graft outcome was assessed by 
      interpreting descriptions in the records; skin viability over ≥ 75% of the graft 
      area between 7 and 14 days after surgery was considered a successful outcome. 
      RESULTS: For 4 of the 58 grafts, graft outcome could not be determined from the 
      medical record. For the remaining grafts, success rate was significantly higher 
      for grafts placed in cats (17/22 [77%]) than in dogs (12/32 [38%]). The overall 
      complication rate was 50%; complications included skin graft failure, donor site 
      dehiscence, and bandage-induced sloughing of skin adjacent to the graft recipient 
      site. In addition to species, anatomic location of the skin defect was identified 
      as a prognostic indicator of graft outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 
      Full-thickness skin grafting had a higher success rate in cats than in dogs. Skin 
      grafts applied to the antebrachium, compared with other locations on the distal 
      aspects of the limbs, were associated with a poorer prognosis.

TI  - Fasciocutaneous Propeller Flap Based on Perforating Branch of Ulnar Artery for 
      Soft Tissue Reconstruction of the Hand and Wrist.
PG  - 74-79
LID - 10.4055/cios.2018.10.1.74 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A skin defect of the hand and wrist is a common manifestation in 
      industrial crushing injuries, traffic accidents or after excision of tumors. We 
      reconstructed a skin defect in the ulnar aspect of the hand and wrist with a 
      perforator-based propeller flap from the ulnar artery. The aims of our study are 
      to evaluate the utility and effectiveness of this flap and to discuss the 
      advantages and disadvantages of the flap in hand and wrist reconstruction with a 
      review of the literature. METHODS: Between April 2011 and November 2016, five 
      cases of skin defect were reconstructed with a perforator-based propeller flap 
      from the ulnar artery. There were four males and one female. The age of patients 
      ranged from 36 to 73 years. Skin defect sites were on the dorso-ulnar side of the 
      hand in three cases and palmar-ulnar side of the wrist in two cases. The size of 
      the skin defect ranged from 4 × 3 cm to 8 × 5 cm. We evaluated the viability of 
      the flap, postoperative complication and patient's satisfaction. RESULTS: There 
      was no failure of flap in all cases. The size of the flap ranged from 4 × 4 cm to 
      12 × 4 cm. One patient, who had a burn scar contracture, presented with limited 
      active and passive motion of the wrist after the operation. The other patients 
      had no complications postoperatively. Cosmetic results of the surgery were 
      excellent in one patient, good in three patients, and fair in one patient. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The fasciocutaneous propeller flap based on a perforating branch of 
      the ulnar artery is a reliable treatment option for the ulnar side skin defect of 
      the hand and wrist.

TI  - Survey of early complications of primary skin graft and secondary skin graft 
      (delayed) surgery after resection of burn waste in hospitalized burn patients.
PG  - 98-102
LID - 10.5539/gjhs.v6n7p98 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Burning is the second most common cause of home injuries in Iran 
      that is often the cause of conflicts between children and young adults. Burning 
      can lead to early and late complications that scar and contracture are the most 
      common. Burn waste treatment is done by two methods: excision and then skin graft 
      after the formation of granulation tissue; and excision and graft simultaneously 
      that in this study, these two methods are compared. METHODS: This was performed 
      as a quasi-experimental analysis and retrospective study on all patients who were 
      hospitalized for burn scar. All patients who have associated with weak 
      eningimmune diseases such as diabetes, acquired immunodeficiency or congenital, 
      taking steroids and patients undergoing chemotherapy etc. are excluded. The 
      method of grafting in patients is primary graft procedure that was compared with 
      patients who are treated using secondary graft. Data collected through review of 
      patients' hospital and clinic chart. RESULTS: The mean burn percentage in the 
      primary repair group was 14.4% and in the delayed repair group was 16.6%, 
      respectively. The incidence of hematoma in both groups was zero. Skin necrosis 
      and graft rejection and infection in the primary repair group was in 3.7% of 
      patients and in the delayed repair group was in 1.2% of cases (P=0.5) CONCLUSION: 
      Based on the findings of this study, no difference was observed between the two 
      methods of excision and primary graft with delayed graft in the incidence of 
      graft rejection. Due to the shorter treatment of primary graft and patient 
      satisfaction and also according to the findings of this study excision and 
      primary graft method seems appropriate method for treating old waste burning.

TI  - Epidermal grafting versus split-thickness skin grafting for wound healing 
      (EPIGRAAFT): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 245
LID - 10.1186/s13063-016-1352-y [doi]
LID - 245
AB  - BACKGROUND: Split-thickness skin grafting (SSG) is an important modality for 
      wound closure. However, the donor site becomes a second, often painful wound, 
      which may take more time to heal than the graft site itself and holds the risk of 
      infection and scarring. Epidermal grafting (EG) is an alternative method of 
      autologous skin grafting that harvests only the epidermal layer of the skin by 
      applying continuous negative pressure on the normal skin to raise blisters. This 
      procedure has minimal donor site morbidity and is relatively pain-free, allowing 
      autologous skin grafting in an outpatient setting. We plan to compare EG to SSG 
      and to further investigate the cellular mechanism by which each technique 
      achieves wound healing. METHODS/DESIGN: EPIGRAAFT is a multicentre, randomised, 
      controlled trial that compares the efficacy and wound-healing mechanism of EG 
      with SSG for wound healing. The primary outcome measures are the proportion of 
      wounds healed in 6 weeks and the donor site healing time. The secondary outcome 
      measures include the mean time for complete wound healing, pain score, patient 
      satisfaction, health care utilisation, cost analysis, and incidence of adverse 
      events. DISCUSSION: This study is expected to define the efficacy of EG and 
      promote further understanding of the mechanism of wound healing by EG compared to 
      SSG. The results of this study can be used to inform the current best practise 
      for wound care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT02535481 .

TI  - The Positive Impact of Donor Bone Marrow Cells Transplantation into 
      Immunoprivileged Compartments on the Survival of Vascularized Skin Allografts.
PG  - 28

LID - 28
AB  - Using the vascularized skin allograft (VSA) model, we compared the tolerogenic 
      effects of different allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) delivery routes 
      into immunoprivileged compartments under a 7-day protocol immunosuppressive 
      therapy. Twenty-eight fully MHC mismatched VSA transplants were performed between 
      ACI (RT1(a)) donors and Lewis (RT1(1)) recipients in four groups of seven animals 
      each, under a 7-day protocol of alfa/beta TCRmAb/CsA (alpha/beta-TCR monoclonal 
      antibodies/Cyclosporine A therapy). Donor bone marrow cells (BMC) (100 × 106 
      cells) were injected into three different immunoprivileged compartments: Group 1: 
      Control, without cellular supportive therapy, Group 2: Intracapsular BMT, Group 
      3: Intragonadal BMT, Group 4: Intrathecal BMT. In Group 2, BMC were transplanted 
      under the kidney capsule. In Group 3, BMC were transplanted into the right testis 
      between tunica albuginea and seminiferous tubules, and in Group 4, cells were 
      injected intrathecally. The assessment included: skin evaluation for signs and 
      grade of rejection and immunohistochemistry for donor cells engraftment into host 
      lymphoid compartments. Donor-specific chimerism for MHC class I (RT1(a)) antigens 
      and the presence of CD4(+)/CD25(+) T cells were assessed in the peripheral blood 
      of recipients. The most extended allograft survival, 50-78 days, was observed in 
      Group 4 after intrathecal BMT. The T cells CD4(+)/CD25(+) in the peripheral blood 
      were higher after intrathecal BMC injection than other experimental groups at 
      each post-transplant time point. Transplantation of BMC into immunoprivileged 
      compartments delayed rejection of fully mismatched VSA and induction of robust, 
      donor-specific chimerism.

      needed between neurosurgeons and cranio-maxillofacial surgeons. We present a 
      considerably large series for which we identify typical complications and 
      pitfalls and provide evidence for the importance of an interdisciplinary 
      algorithm for chronic wound healing complications and malignomas of the scalp and 
      skull. We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated by the department of 
      neurosurgery and cranio-maxillofacial surgery at our hospital for complex scalp 
      deficiencies and malignant scalp tumors affecting the skull between 2006 and 
      2019, and extracted data on demographics, surgical technique, and perioperative 
      complications. Thirty-seven patients were treated. Most cases were operated 
      simultaneously (n: 32) and 6 cases in a staged procedure. Nineteen patients 
      obtained a free flap for scalp reconstruction, 15 were treated with local axial 
      flaps, and 3 patients underwent full thickness skin graft treatment. 
      Complications occurred in 62% of cases, mostly related to cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF) circulation disorders. New cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) disturbances occurred 
      in 8 patients undergoing free flaps and shunt dysfunction occurred in 5 patients 
      undergoing local axial flaps. Four patients died shortly after the surgical 
      procedure (perioperative mortality 10.8%). Combined scalp and skull deficiency 
      present a challenging task. An interdisciplinary treatment helps to prevent 
      severe and specialty-specific complications, such as hydrocephalus. We therefore 
      recommend a close neurological observation after reconstructive treatment with 
      focus on symptoms of CSF disturbances.

AB  - Hematopoietic chimerism after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may 
      establish a state of donor antigen-specific tolerance. However, current 
      allotransplantation protocols involve genotoxic conditioning which has harmful 
      side-effects and predisposes to infection and cancer. Here we describe a 
      non-genotoxic conditioning protocol for fully MHC-mismatched bone marrow 
      allotransplantation in mice involving transient immunosuppression and selective 
      depletion of recipient hematopoietic stem cells with a 
      CD117-antibody-drug-conjugate (ADC). This protocol resulted in multilineage, high 
      level (up to 50%), durable, donor-derived hematopoietic chimerism after 
      transplantation of 20 million total bone marrow cells, compared with ≤ 2.1% 
      hematopoietic chimerism from 50 million total bone marrow cells without 
      conditioning. Moreover, long-term survival of bone marrow donor-type but not 
      third party skin allografts is achieved in CD117-ADC-conditioned chimeric mice 
      without chronic immunosuppression. The only observed adverse event is transient 
      elevation of liver enzymes in the first week after conditioning. These results 
      provide proof-of-principle for CD117-ADC as a non-genotoxic, highly-targeted 
      conditioning agent in allotransplantation and tolerance protocols.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Delayed and incomplete healing of the skin graft at the donor site 
      of an LD flap is common because of seroma formation. The authors aimed to 
      evaluate whether the application of an NPD could improve the healing process 
      after STSG at LD donor sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July 2019 to September 
      2021, 32 patients underwent STSG with NPD at the LD donor site, and 27 patients 
      underwent STSG with TBDs. Data were collected and analyzed using the chi-square 
      test, t test, and Spearman correlation test. RESULTS: The overall Spearman 
      correlations of graft loss with seroma, hematoma, and infection were 0.56 (P 
      <.01), 0.64 (P <.01), and 0.70 (P <.01), respectively. Compared with the TBD 
      group, the STSG take rate was significantly higher in the NPD group (90.3% vs 
      84.5%, P =.046) while the seroma rate (18.8% vs 44.4%, P =.033), graft loss (9.4% 
      vs 29.6%, P =.047), and mean length of stay (10.9 ± 1.8 vs 12.1 ± 2.4, P =.037) 
      were significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: NPDs for STSG at the LD donor site 
      contribute significantly to improved graft acceptance with reduced seroma 
      formation.

AB  - Acute cellular rejection remains a significant obstacle affecting successful 
      outcomes of organ transplantation including vascularized composite tissue 
      allografts (VCA). Donor antigen presenting cells (APCs), particularly dendritic 
      cells (DCs), orchestrate early alloimmune responses by activating recipient 
      effector T cells. Employing a targeted approach, we investigated the impact of 
      donor-derived conventional DCs (cDCs) and APCs on the immunogenicity of skin and 
      skin-containing VCA grafts, using mouse models of skin and hind limb 
      transplantation. By post-transplantation day 6, skin grafts demonstrated severe 
      rejections, characterized by predominance of recipient CD4 T cells. In contrast, 
      hind limb grafts showed moderate rejection, primarily infiltrated by CD8 T cells. 
      Notably, the skin component exhibited heightened immunogenicity when compared to 
      the entire VCA, evidenced by increased frequencies of pan (CD11b(-)CD11c(+)), 
      mature (CD11b(-)CD11c(+)MHCII(+)) and active (CD11b(-)CD11c(+)CD40(+)) DCs and 
      cDC2 subset (CD11b(+)CD11c(+) MHCII(+)) in the lymphoid tissues and the blood of 
      skin transplant recipients. While donor depletion of cDC and APC reduced 
      frequencies, maturation and activation of DCs in all analyzed tissues of skin 
      transplant recipients, reduction in DC activities was only observed in the spleen 
      of hind limb recipients. Donor cDC and APC depletion did not impact all 
      lymphocyte compartments but significantly affected CD8 T cells and activated CD4 
      T in lymph nodes of skin recipients. Moreover, both donor APC and cDC depletion 
      attenuated the Th17 immune response, evident by significantly reduced Th17 
      (CD4(+)IL-17(+)) cells in the spleen of skin recipients and reduced levels of 
      IL-17E and lymphotoxin-α in the serum samples of both skin and hind limb 
      recipients. In conclusion, our findings underscore the highly immunogenic nature 
      of skin component in VCA. The depletion of donor APCs and cDCs mitigates the 
      immunogenicity of skin grafts while exerting minimal impact on VCA.

TI  - Outcomes of Split-thickness Skin Grafting for Foot and Ankle Wounds in Patients 
      With Peripheral Arterial Disease.
PG  - 272-278
LID - WNDS20190915-2 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tissue ischemia resulting from arterial insufficiency is a major 
      factor affecting lower extremity wound healing in patients with peripheral 
      arterial disease (PAD). Accelerated wound closure with split-thickness skin 
      grafting (STSG) provides a durable barrier to infection and can prevent limb 
      loss. Published STSG outcomes data are minimal in the post endovascular 
      intervention population. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the authors examine factors 
      predictive of STSG healing in patients with PAD following vascular intervention, 
      including the effect of non-inline flow via arterial-arterial and non-arterial 
      collateralization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with PAD and wounds of the 
      foot and ankle who underwent STSG between January 2014 and December 2016 were 
      retrospectively reviewed. All patients received angiographic evaluation and 
      endovascular or open revascularization where necessary. Effects of extremity 
      revascularizations, STSG percent take, and amputation rate were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with 47 wounds underwent STSG. There were 21 men 
      and 14 women with a mean age of 64 ± 13 years. Revascularization was required in 
      23 patients (25 extremities) before STSG, with balloon angioplasty for tibial 
      artery lesions as the most common revascularization. Patent pedal arch was 
      present in 8 patients; 35 patients had an absent or incomplete pedal arch. 
      Patients with a fully patent pedal arch healed at a significantly higher rate 
      than those with an absent or incomplete pedal arch at 1 month (62.5% vs. 17.1%, P 
      ⟨ .05). At 90-day follow-up, 9 of 35 (25.7%) patients with 9 of 47 (19.1%) wounds 
      were lost to follow-up, leaving 18 of 38 (47.37%) wounds healed and 20 (52.63%) 
      still open. Ultimately, 36 of 47 (76.60%) wounds healed and 6 major amputations 
      in 6 patients were required at a mean 502 ± 342 days follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results suggest the importance of arterial-arterial connections such as the 
      pedal arch to the healing potential of foot and ankle wounds after STSG in this 
      high-risk patient population.

AB  - The main aim of this work was to study the usefulness of human β-defensins 2 
      (BD-2) and 3 (BD-3), which are part of the innate immune system, in the treatment 
      of infected ischemic skin flaps. We investigated the effect of transducing rat 
      ischemic skin flaps with lentiviral vectors encoding human BD-2, BD-3, or both 
      BD-2 and BD-3, to increase flap survival in the context of a P. aeruginosa 
      infection associated with a foreign body. The secondary endpoints assessed were: 
      bacterial counts, and biofilm formation on the surface of the foreign body. A 
      local ischemic environment was created by producing arterialized venous flaps in 
      the left epigastric region of rats. Flaps were intentionally infected by placing 
      underneath them two catheters with 10(5) CFU of P. aeruginosa before the surgical 
      wounds were hermetically closed. Flap biopsies were performed 3 and 7 days 
      post-operatively, and the specimens submitted to immunohistochemical analysis for 
      BD-2 and BD-3, as well as to bacterial quantification. Subsequently, the catheter 
      segments were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Flaps transduced 
      with BD-2 and BD-3 showed expression of these defensins and presented increased 
      flap survival. Rats transduced with BD-3 presented a net reduction in the number 
      of P. aeruginosa on the surface of the foreign body and lesser biofilm formation.

TI  - Subdominant H60 antigen-specific CD8 T-cell response precedes dominant H4 
      antigen-specific response during the initial phase of allogenic skin graft 
      rejection.
PG  - e140
LID - 10.1038/emm.2014.107 [doi]
AB  - In allogeneic transplantation, including the B6 anti-BALB.B settings, H60 and H4 
      are two representative dominant minor histocompatibility antigens that induce 
      strong CD8 T-cell responses. With different distribution patterns, H60 expression 
      is restricted to hematopoietic cells, whereas H4 is ubiquitously expressed. 
      H60-specific CD8 T-cell response has been known to be dominant in most cases of 
      B6 anti-BALB.B allo-responses, except in the case of skin transplantation. To 
      understand the mechanism underlying the subdominance of H60 during allogeneic 
      skin transplantation, we investigated the dynamics of the H60-specific CD8 T 
      cells in B6 mice transplanted with allogeneic BALB.B tail skin. Unexpectedly, 
      longitudinal bioluminescence imaging and flow cytometric analyses revealed that 
      H60-specific CD8 T cells were not always subdominant to H4-specific cells but 
      instead showed a brief dominance before the H4 response became predominant. 
      H60-specific CD8 T cells could expand in the draining lymph node and migrate to 
      the BALB.B allografts, indicating their active participation in the anti-BALB.B 
      allo-response. Enhancing the frequencies of H60-reactive CD8 T cells prior to 
      skin transplantation reversed the immune hierarchy between H60 and H4. 
      Additionally, H60 became predominant when antigen presentation was limited to the 
      direct pathway. However, when antigen presentation was restricted to the indirect 
      pathway, the expansion of H60-specific CD8 T cells was limited, whereas 
      H4-specific CD8 T cells expanded significantly, suggesting that the temporary 
      immunodominance and eventual subdominance of H60 could be due to their reliance 
      on the direct antigen presentation pathway. These results enhance our 
      understanding of the immunodominance phenomenon following allogeneic tissue 
      transplantation.

TI  - The Effects of an IL-21 Receptor Antagonist on the Alloimmune Response in a 
      Humanized Mouse Skin Transplant Model.
PG  - 2065-2074
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000002773 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin 21 (IL-21) is involved in regulating the expansion and 
      effector function of a broad range of leukocytes, including T cells and B cells. 
      In transplantation, the exact role of IL-21 in the process of allograft rejection 
      is unknown. To further explore this, the aim of this study is to test the effect 
      of an IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) blocking antibody on the early phase of allograft 
      rejection in a humanized skin transplantation model in mice reconstituted with 
      human T and B cells. METHODS: Immunodeficient Balb/c IL2rγRag2 mice were 
      transplanted with human skin followed by adoptive transfer of human allogeneic 
      splenocytes. Control animals were treated with a phosphate buffered saline 
      vehicle while the other group was treated with a humanized anti-IL-21R antibody 
      (αIL-21R). RESULTS: In the phosphate buffered saline-treated animals, human skin 
      allografts were infiltrated with lymphocytes and developed a thickened epidermis 
      with increased expression of the inflammatory markers Keratin 17 (Ker17) and 
      Ki67. In mice treated with αIL-21R, these signs of allograft reactivity were 
      significantly reduced. Concordantly, STAT3 phosphorylation was inhibited in this 
      group. Of note, treatment with αIL-21R attenuated the process of T and B cell 
      reconstitution after adoptive cellular transfer. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      demonstrate that blockade of IL-21 signaling can delay allograft rejection in a 
      humanized skin transplantation model.

TI  - In Utero Exposure to Exosomal and B-Cell Alloantigens Lessens Alloreactivity of

AB  - According to actively acquired tolerance, antigen exposure before full immune 
      development in fetal or early neonatal life will cause tolerance to this specific 
      antigen. In this study, we aimed to examine whether allogeneic tolerance could be 
      elicited by in utero exposure to surface MHC antigens of allogenic cells or 
      soluble form of MHC exosomes. Gestational day 14 FVB/N fetuses were subjected to 
      intraperitoneal injection of allogeneic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
      exosomes or highly enriched B-cells. Postnatally, the recipients were examined 
      for the immune responses to donor alloantigens by lymphocyte proliferative 
      reactions and skin transplantation. In utero exposure to allogeneic MHC exosomes 
      abolished the alloreactivity of recipients' lymphocytes to the alloantigens, but 
      could not confer skin allograft tolerance. In utero transplantation of highly 
      enriched allogeneic B-cells generated low-level B-cell chimerism in the 
      recipients. However, it only extended the survivals of skin allograft by a few 
      days despite the lack of donor-specific alloreactivity of recipients' lymphocyte. 
      Thus, an early in utero contact with exosomal or B-cell alloantigens did not lead 
      to full skin tolerance but rather, at best, only to delayed skin rejection in the 
      presence of microchimerism made by B-cell inocula. These results argued against 
      the theory of actively acquired tolerance, and implicated that in utero exposure 
      to marrow cells in previous studies was a unique model of allo-tolerance 
      induction that involved the establishment of significant hematopoietic chimerism. 
      Taken together with the discovery of in utero sensitization to ovalbumin in our 
      previous studies, the immunological consequences of fetal exposure to foreign 
      antigens might vary according to the type or nature of antigens introduced.

TI  - Negative-pressure wound therapy combined with artificial dermis (Terudermis) 
      followed by split-thickness skin graft might be an effective treatment option for 
      wounds exposing tendon and bone: A retrospective observation study.

AB  - Skin grafts are not suitable for closing tendon- or bone-exposing wounds, which 
      require flap surgery. Dermal regeneration templates have value for closing such 
      wounds, but the disadvantages of the technique include implantation failures 
      because of infection, hematoma formation, or inappropriate immobilization. 
      Negative-pressure wound therapy was reported to increase graft acceptance in 
      difficult wounds.This retrospective case series of 65 patients evaluated 
      negative-pressure therapy combined with artificial dermis for the treatment of 
      acute or chronic tendon- or bone-exposing wounds. The artificial dermis was 
      placed after adequate wound-bed preparation, with simultaneous application of a 
      vacuum-assisted closure system. Split-thickness skin grafting was performed after 
      the implanted artificial dermis had become established.The overall success rate 
      was 88.1% (59/67): 88.6% (39/44) in the chronic wounds group and 87% (20/23) in 
      the acute-trauma group separately. The overall mean survival time of artificial 
      dermis in success cases was 13.24 ± 7.14 days. In separately, the survival time 
      of artificial dermis had no statistically difference in chronic wound group 
      (13.64 ± 7.53 vs 12.60 ± 5.86. P = .943), but had significant statistical 
      difference in acute trauma group (12.45 ± 6.44 days vs 23.33 ± 4.04 days, 
      P = .018). Also, comorbidity of PAOD was found a strong risk factor of failure in 
      chronic wound group (100% vs 23.1%, P < 0.001).We concluded that artificial 
      dermis combined with negative-pressure therapy followed by split-thickness skin 
      grafting might be a reliable and effective option for surgical reconstruction of 
      tendon- or bone-exposing wounds, and could decreasing waiting periods of 
      autologous skin graft.

TI  - Donor CD47 controls T cell alloresponses and is required for tolerance induction 
      following hepatocyte allotransplantation.
PG  - 26839

LID - 26839
AB  - CD47-deficient hepatocyte transplantation induces rapid innate immune cell 
      activation and subsequent associated graft loss in syngeneic recipients. However, 
      the role of donor CD47 in regulation of T-cell alloresponses is poorly 
      understood. We addressed this question by assessing OVA-specific immune responses 
      in mice following hepatocyte transplantation from CD47-competent or -deficient 
      OVA-transgenic donors. Compared to sham-operated controls, intrasplenic 
      transplantation of CD47-deficient OVA(+) hepatocytes significantly accelerated 
      rejection of OVA(+) skin grafted 7 days after hepatocyte transplantation. In 
      contrast, mice receiving CD47-competent OVA(+) hepatocytes showed prolonged and 
      even indefinite survival of OVA(+) skin allografts. T cells from mice receiving 
      CD47-deficient, but not CD47-competent, OVA(+) hepatocytes showed significantly 
      enhanced responses to OVA(+) stimulators compared to sham-operated controls. In 
      contrast to the production of tolerogenic cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in the 
      recipients of CD47-competent hepatocytes, mice receiving CD47-deficient 
      hepatocytes showed elevated production of IFN-γ and IL-1α. Moreover, significant 
      expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells was detected in the recipients of 
      CD47-competent hepatocytes, which was required for tolerance induction in these 
      mice. Thus, donor CD47 plays an important role in the control of T-cell 
      alloresponses and tolerance induction following hepatocyte transplantation. Our 
      data also suggest that intrasplenic hepatocyte transplantation may provide a 
      means to induce allograft tolerance.

LID - 10.1111/ajt.12554 [doi]
AB  - Memory T cells (Tm) represent a major barrier for immunosuppression and tolerance 
      induction after solid organ transplantation. Taking into consideration the 
      critical role of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in the generation and 
      maintenance of Tm, we developed a new concept to deplete alloreactive Tm by 
      targeting Bcl-2 proteins. The small-molecule Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor ABT-737 
      efficiently induced apoptosis in alloreactive Tm in vitro and in vivo and 
      prolonged skin graft survival in sensitized recipients. A short course of ABT-737 
      induction therapy prevented Tm-mediated resistance in a donor-specific 
      transfusion model and allowed mixed chimerism induction across Tm barriers. Since 
      Bcl-2 inhibitors yielded encouraging safety results in cancer trials, this novel 
      approach might represent a substantial advance to prevent allograft rejection and 
      induce tolerance in sensitized recipients.

TI  - CD8+CD122+PD-1+ Tregs Synergize With Costimulatory Blockade of CD40/CD154, but 
      Not B7/CD28, to Prolong Murine Allograft Survival.

AB  - A transplanted organ is always rejected in the absence of any immunosuppressive 
      treatment due to vigorous alloimmunity. However, continuously global 
      immunosuppression with a conventional immunosuppressant may result in severe side 
      effects, including nephrotoxicity, tumors and infections. Tregs have been widely 
      used to inhibit allograft rejection, especially in animal models. However, it's 
      well accepted that administration of Tregs alone is not satisfactory in 
      immune-competent wild-type animals. Therefore, it's imperative to promote Treg 
      therapies under the cover of other approaches, including costimulatory blockade. 
      In the present study, we demonstrated that administration of in vitro-expanded 
      CD8(+)CD122(+)PD-1(+) Tregs synergized with costimulatory blockade of CD40/CD154, 
      but not B7/CD28, to prolong skin allograft survival in wild-type mice and to 
      reduce cellular infiltration in skin allografts as well. Treg treatment and 
      blockade of CD40/CD154, but not B7/CD28, also exhibited an additive effect on 
      suppression of T cell proliferation in vitro and pro-inflammatory cytokine 
      expression in skin allografts. Importantly, blocking B7/CD28, but not CD40/CD154, 
      costimulation decreased the number of transferred CD8(+)CD122(+)PD-1(+) Tregs and 
      their expression of IL-10 in recipient mice. Furthermore, it's B7/CD28, but not 
      CD40/CD154, costimulatory blockade that dramatically reduced IL-10 production by 
      CD8(+)CD122(+)PD-1(+) Tregs in vitro, suggesting that B7/CD28, but not 
      CD40/CD154, costimulation is critical for their production of IL-10. Indeed, 
      infusion of IL-10-deficient CD8(+)CD122(+)PD-1(+) Tregs failed to synergize with 
      anti-CD154 Ab treatment to further prolong allograft survival. Our data may 
      explain why blocking B7/CD28 costimulatory pathway does not boost IL-10-dependent 
      Treg suppression of alloimmunity. Thus, these findings could be implicated in 
      clinical organ transplantation.

TI  - Guiding T lymphopoiesis from pluripotent stem cells by defined transcription 
      factors.

AB  - Achievement of immunocompetent and therapeutic T lymphopoiesis from pluripotent 
      stem cells (PSCs) is a central aim in T cell regenerative medicine. To date, 
      preferentially reconstituting T lymphopoiesis in vivo from PSCs remains a 
      practical challenge. Here we documented that synergistic and transient expression 
      of Runx1 and Hoxa9 restricted in the time window of endothelial-to-hematopoietic 
      transition and hematopoietic maturation stages in a PSC differentiation scheme 
      (iR9-PSC) in vitro induced preferential generation of engraftable hematopoietic 
      progenitors capable of homing to thymus and developing into mature T cells in 
      primary and secondary immunodeficient recipients. Single-cell transcriptome and 
      functional analyses illustrated the cellular trajectory of T lineage induction 
      from PSCs, unveiling the T-lineage specification determined at as early as 
      hemogenic endothelial cell stage and identifying the bona fide pre-thymic 
      progenitors. The induced T cells distributed normally in central and peripheral 
      lymphoid organs and exhibited abundant TCRαβ repertoire. The regenerative T 
      lymphopoiesis restored immune surveillance in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, 
      gene-edited iR9-PSCs produced tumor-specific T cells in vivo that effectively 
      eradicated tumor cells. This study provides insight into universal generation of 
      functional and therapeutic T cells from the unlimited and editable PSC source.

      and allogeneic skin grafts permits serial grafting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current standard of care for burns requiring operative treatment 
      consists of early burn excision and autologous split-thickness skin grafting. 
      However, in large burns, sufficient donor sites may not be available to achieve 
      total coverage, necessitating temporary coverage with allogeneic human cadaver 
      skin grafts or synthetic skin substitutes. A previous study from this laboratory 
      demonstrated that skin grafts from alpha-1,3 galactosyltransferase knockout 
      (GalT-KO) miniature swine enjoyed survival comparable to that of allogeneic skin 
      grafts in baboons. METHODS: In the present study, we have evaluated the immune 
      response against sequential GalT-KO and allogeneic skin grafts to determine 
      whether such serial grafts could extend the period of temporary wound coverage 
      before definitive grafting with autologous skin. RESULTS: We report that 
      rejection of primary GalT-KO skin grafts led to an anti-xenogeneic humoral 
      response with no evidence for sensitization to alloantigens nor acceleration of 
      rejection of allogeneic skin grafts. Similarly, presensitization with allogeneic 
      skin did not lead to accelerated rejection of xenogeneic skin. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      data suggest that GalT-KO skin grafts could provide an early first-line treatment 
      in the management of severe burns that would not preclude subsequent use of 
      allografts, and that serial grafting of GalT-KO skin and allogeneic skin could 
      potentially be used to provide an extended period of temporary burn wound 
      coverage.

TI  - Surviving an Extensive Burn Injury Using Advanced Skin Replacement Technologies.
PG  - 1288-1291
LID - 10.1093/jbcr/irab146 [doi]
AB  - There have been significant improvements in the technology available for treating 
      extensive burns in the past decade. This case presents two unique, skin 
      replacement technologies that were used to treat an 86% surface area flame burn 
      in a pediatric patient. A temporary dermal replacement, known as "Novosorb™ 
      Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix" was first used to stabilize the burn injury and 
      remained in place for approximately 3 months. Given the large burn size and lack 
      of available donor skin for grafting, a permanent skin replacement product known 
      as "Self-Assembled Skin Substitute (SASS)" was then utilized to cover the burns. 
      SASS is a novel technology that was developed to replace skin as an autologous 
      skin graft and is currently available in Canada through a clinical trial for 
      major burns. Ultimately, the concurrent use of these two technologies allowed for 
      the unprecedented survival of a child following an extensive and life-threatening 
      burn injury.

      ASFA ECP subcommittee.
PG  - 215-223
LID - 10.1002/jca.21486 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many apheresis centers offer extracorporeal photopheresis 
      (ECP), little is known about current treatment practices. METHODS: An electronic 
      survey was distributed to assess ECP practice internationally. RESULTS: Of 251 
      responses, 137 met criteria for analysis. Most respondents were from North 
      America (80%). Nurses perform ECP at most centers (84%) and the majority of 
      centers treat adults only (52%). Most centers treat fewer than 50 patients/year 
      (83%) and perform fewer than 300 procedures/year (70%). Closed system devices 
      (XTS and/or Cellex) are used to perform ECP at most centers (96%). The most 
      common indications for ECP are acute/chronic skin graft versus host disease (89%) 
      and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (63%). The typical wait time for ECP treatment is 
      less than 2 weeks (91%). Most centers do not routinely perform quality control 
      assessment of the collected product (66%). There are device-specific differences 
      in treatment parameters. For example, XTS users more frequently have a minimum 
      weight limit (P = 0.003) and use laboratory parameters to determine eligibility 
      for treatment (P = 0.03). Regardless of device used, the majority of centers 
      assess the clinical status of the patient before each procedure. Greater than 50% 
      of respondents would defer treatment for hemodynamic instability due to active 
      sepsis or heart failure, positive blood culture in the past 24 h or current 
      fever. CONCLUSION: This survey based study describes current ECP practices. 
      Further research to provide evidence for optimal standardization of patient 
      qualifications, procedure parameters and product quality assessment is 
      recommended.

TI  - Comparison of Efficacy and Complications Between Negative Pressure Wound Therapy 
      and Conventional Mechanical Fixation in Skin Grafts: A Retrospective Analysis.
PG  - 213-218
LID - WNDS20190630-3 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Graft fixation is critical for the successful survival of a skin 
      graft. Conventional mechanical fixation may induce inappropriate pressure and 
      increase wound complications. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) could be 
      utilized to secure a skin graft and improve drainage. Limited quantitative data 
      exist on the efficacy of NPWT for skin grafting. OBJECTIVE: This retrospective 
      study compares the efficacy and complications between NPWT and conventional 
      mechanical fixation in skin grafts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent 
      skin graft surgery from January 2015 to December 2016 at a large university 
      hospital in southwest China were retrospectively analyzed. Characteristics, 
      including wound pattern, skin graft type, surgical procedure, survival rate, and 
      postoperative complication, were statistically analyzed by Pearson chi-square or 
      Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A total of 186 patients were included in the study; 
      72 received NPWT and 114 received conventional mechanical dressing fixation after 
      skin grafting. Overall survival rate of full-thickness skin grafts was 
      significantly higher in the NPWT group than the dressing group (P ⟨ .01). The 
      NPWT group showed a higher survival rate than the dressing group for each 
      anatomic site, but only patients who had skin grafts of the hand exhibited 
      statistically significant results. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a quantitative 
      analysis of the efficacy of NPWT on skin graft fixation with NPWT providing 
      consistent pressure and better drainage than conventional mechanical fixation. In 
      addition, the use of NPWT also could increase graft take on the hand region.

      underwent traditional skin grafting (SG group). The operative time, follow-up 
      time, complications, Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) score, and Scar Cosmesis 
      Assessment and Rating (SCAR) score of the two groups were statistically analyzed. 
      RESULTS: The mean follow-up times in the MDC and SG group were 16.1 and 16.7 
      months, respectively. Two patients showed partial skin necrosis after skin 
      grafting, but the remaining patients' wounds healed uneventfully. The operative 
      time in the MDC group was an average of about 64 minutes shorter than that in the 
      SG group. The average VSS and SCAR scores in the MDC group were 2.1 and 3.0 
      points lower, respectively, than those in the SG group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared 
      with traditional skin grafting, the modified direct closure method is more 
      efficient for repair of wounds at the ALT flap donor site because of its shorter 
      operative time, better postoperative appearance of the donor site, and higher 
      patient satisfaction.

TI  - Importance of B cells to development of regulatory T cells and prolongation of 
      tissue allograft survival in recipients receiving autologous bone marrow 
      transplantation.
PG  - 465-475
LID - 10.1111/imm.12895 [doi]
AB  - We previously showed that congenic bone marrow transplantation (BMTx) post 
      myeloablation augmented tissue allograft survival in association with increased 
      regulatory T (Treg) cells of both host and bone marrow donor origin. Regulatory B 
      (Breg) cells can also modulate T-cell immunity and B cells may be implicated in 
      the development of Treg cells. Accordingly, we explored the effect of B-cell 
      depletion in vivo on augmented graft survival post BMTx. C57BL/6 mice received 
      BALB/c skin allografts followed 7 days later by myeloablation using 
      cyclophosphamide and busulphan. Mice then received T-cell-depleted bone marrow 
      from CD45.1 congenic donors, and ongoing immunosuppression with rapamycin (to day 
      28 after BMTx). Control mice received cyclophosphamide and busulphan followed by 
      rapamycin, but not congenic bone marrow. At different times post BMTx, mice 
      received B-cell-depleting antibody treatment, and the effect on both skin graft 
      survival, and induction of Treg cells was assessed. BMTx resulted in 
      significantly prolonged skin graft survival versus control mice, in association 
      with attenuated donor-specific alloreactivity relative to controls, increased 
      splenic Treg cells and significantly diminished anti-donor IgG. In mice receiving 
      infusion of B-depleting antibodies for 12 days from day 15 post BMTx, both graft 
      survival and Treg cell activity were diminished, particularly for functional Treg 
      cells of donor origin. Adoptive transfer of Breg cells from mice harvested at 
      15 days post BMTx prolonged survival in naive transplanted mice and increased 
      Treg cell levels. Thus, autologous BMTx augmentation of graft survival is 
      dependent in part upon a population of Breg cells that can modulate the function 
      of donor-derived Treg cells.

TI  - Selective blockade of CD28 on human T cells facilitates regulation of alloimmune 
      responses.
LID - 89381 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.89381 [doi]
LID - e89381
AB  - T cells are central to the detrimental alloresponses that develop in autoimmunity 
      and transplantation, with CD28 costimulatory signals being key to T cell 
      activation and proliferation. CTLA4-Ig molecules that bind CD80/86 and inhibit 
      CD28 costimulation offer an alternative immunosuppressive treatment, free from 
      some of the chronic toxicities associated with calcineurin inhibition. However, 
      CD80/86 blockade by CTLA4-Ig also results in the loss of coinhibitory CTLA4 
      signals that are critical to the regulation of T cell activation. Here, we show 
      that a nonactivating monovalent anti-CD28 that spares CTLA4 signaling is an 
      effective immunosuppressant in a clinically relevant humanized mouse transplant 
      model. We demonstrate that selective CD28 blockade prolongs human skin allograft 
      survival through a mechanism that includes a reduction in the cellular graft 
      infiltrate. Critically, selective CD28 blockade promotes Treg function in vivo 
      and synergizes with adoptive Treg therapy to promote transplant survival. In 
      contrast to CTLA4-Ig treatment, selective CD28 blockade promotes regulation of 
      alloimmune responses and facilitates Treg-based cellular therapy.

TI  - Retrospective study of the application of acellular dermis in reconstructing 
      full-thickness skin defects.
PG  - 158-164
LID - 10.1111/iwj.12576 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the article is to evaluate the acellular dermis' utility in 
      reconstructing full-thickness defects after scar contracture releasing and giant 
      nevus resection. From the year 2012 to 2014, 18 consecutive patients underwent 
      composite graft (thin autograft and alloderma) transplantation. Among these 
      patients, 16 patients suffered from burned scar contracture in the upper 
      extremities, and two young cases were met with giant nevus on the upper 
      extremity. Ten of 13 adult cases with upper extremity scar affection were chosen 
      for a comparative study. Twenty hands were randomly allocated into group A and 
      group B. The thick autograft was used to repair one upper extremity in group B, 
      and the composite grafts were used to cover the other upper extremity in group A. 
      Besides appraisal of the recipient sites' function and aesthetics, donor sites 
      were also estimated after a mean of 12 months' follow-up through the Vancouver 
      Scar Score Scale. After evaluation in the above comparative study through the 
      Vancouver Score Scale, in the recipient evaluation, no statistical difference was 
      found in the pigmentation score between two groups, while statistical difference 
      was achieved in other aspects (vascularity, pliability, height). In the donor 
      site's evaluation, statistical difference was established between the two groups 
      in all facets. One adult patient was dissatisfied with the hypertrophic scar on 
      the donor site, and about almost a half of the area became a hypertrophic scar in 
      the recipient site. No atrophic change occurred; one little girl, suffering from 
      large nevus, was operated on by removing nearly the whole giant nevus on the 
      upper limb. Unfortunately, she presented with finger tip necrosis occurring. The 
      finger tip was not ultimately preserved and was repaired with an abdomen flap. 
      Acellular dermal matrix is an excellent option and a useful tool for 
      reconstructing large full-thickness skin defects after releasing burned scar 
      contracture and removing giant nevus. With thin-skin graft meshed, a donor site's 
      presentation brings courage to patients, while recipient sites can reach nearly 
      the same elasticity and function compared to thick-grafted skin.

TI  - Interleukin 21 (IL-21) regulates chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in murine 
      heart allograft rejection.
PG  - e0225624
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0225624 [doi]
LID - e0225624
AB  - IL-21 is the most recently discovered common gamma-chain cytokine that promotes 
      persistent T-cell responses in chronic infections, autoimmunity and cancer. 
      However, the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the IL-21-BATF signaling axis, 
      particularly in transplant rejection, remains unclear. We used heart transplant 
      models to examine the effects of IL-21 blockade in prevention of chronic cardiac 
      allograft vasculopathy (CAV) using genetic knock-out and therapeutic approaches. 
      Both wild-type C57BL/6 and IL-21-/- strains acutely rejected Balb/c skin grafts 
      and once immunized with this skin graft, rejected Balb/c heart allografts in an 
      accelerated fashion. However, when transplanted with heart grafts from the 
      class-II major histocompatibility complex mutant, B6bm12 mice; wild-type 
      recipients developed CAV, while IL-21-/- recipients were protected, even at day 
      100 post-transplant. Similarly, BATF-/- recipients, lacking the transcription 
      factor BATF responsible for IL-21 production, did not develop CAV in B6-bm12 
      heart allografts. Strikingly, in a transient treatment protocol, the development 
      of CAV in wild-type recipients of B6-bm12 hearts allografts was blocked by the 
      administration of IL-21 receptor fusion protein (R-Fc). Thus, we demonstrate that 
      CAV is regulated at least in part by IL-21 signaling and its blockade by genetic 
      approaches or therapy with IL-21R-Fc prevents CAV in mice.

TI  - The Effect of MHC Antigen Matching Between Donors and Recipients on Skin 
      Tolerance of Vascularized Composite Allografts.
PG  - 1729-1741
LID - 10.1111/ajt.14189 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of skin-containing vascularized composite allografts (VCAs) has 
      provided impetus to understand factors affecting rejection and tolerance of skin. 
      VCA tolerance can be established in miniature swine across haploidentical MHC 
      barriers using mixed chimerism. Because the deceased donor pool for VCAs does not 
      permit MHC antigen matching, clinical VCAs are transplanted across varying MHC 
      disparities. We investigated whether sharing of MHC class I or II antigens 
      between donors and recipients influences VCA skin tolerance. Miniature swine were 
      conditioned nonmyeloablatively and received hematopoietic stem cell transplants 
      and VCAs across MHC class I (n = 3) or class II (n = 3) barriers. In vitro immune 
      responsiveness was assessed, and VCA skin-resident leukocytes were characterized 
      by flow cytometry. Stable mixed chimerism was established in all animals. MHC 
      class II-mismatched chimeras were tolerant of VCAs. MHC class I-mismatched 
      animals, however, rejected VCA skin, characterized by infiltration of 
      recipient-type CD8(+) lymphocytes. Systemic donor-specific nonresponsiveness was 
      maintained, including after VCA rejection. This study shows that MHC antigen 
      matching influences VCA skin rejection and suggests that local regulation of 
      immune tolerance is critical in long-term acceptance of all VCA components. These 
      results help elucidate novel mechanisms underlying skin tolerance and identify 
      clinically relevant VCA tolerance strategies.

TI  - Therapeutic implications of NK cell regulation of allogeneic CD8 T cell-mediated 
      immune responses stimulated through the direct pathway of antigen presentation in 
      transplantation.
PG  - 1030-1044
LID - 10.1080/19420862.2018.1502127 [doi]
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are a population of innate type I lymphoid cells 
      essential for early anti-viral responses and are known to modulate the course of 
      humoral and cellular-mediated T cell responses. We assessed the role of NK cells 
      in allogeneic CD8 T cell-mediated responses in an immunocompetent mouse model 
      across an MHC class I histocompatibility barrier to determine its impact in 
      therapeutic clinical interventions with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies 
      (mAbs) targeting lymphoid cells in transplantation. The administration of an NK 
      cell depleting antibody to either CD8 T cell replete or CD8 T cell-depleted naïve 
      C57BL/6 immunocompetent mice accelerated graft rejection. This accelerated 
      rejection response was associated with an in vivo increased cytotoxic activity of 
      CD8 T cells against bm1 allogeneic hematopoietic cells and bm1 skin allografts. 
      These findings show that NK cells were implicated in the control host anti-donor 
      cytotoxic responses, likely by competing for common cell growth factors in both 
      CD8 T cell replete and CD8 T cell-depleted mice, the latter reconstituting in 
      response to lymphopenia. Our data calls for precaution in solid organ 
      transplantation under tolerogenic protocols involving extensive depletion of 
      lymphocytes. These pharmacological biologics with depleting properties over NK 
      cells may accelerate graft rejection and promote aggressive CD8 T cell cytotoxic 
      alloresponses refractory to current immunosuppression.

TI  - Amniotic Suspension Allograft and Fetal Bovine Acellular Dermal Matrix to Treat 
      Complex, Acute, Full-thickness Wounds: A Retrospective Analysis of Safety and 
      Treatment Efficacy.
PG  - 30-36
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Comorbidities; inadequate vascularity; exposure of bones, tendons, 
      or other avascular structures; and loss or removal of significant tissue volume 
      all complicate the clinical treatment of patients with large, acute wounds. A 
      number of amniotic tissue products are currently available for wound healing and 
      other applications; one of these is a human amniotic suspension allograft (ASA) 
      consisting of particulated human amniotic membrane and cells from the amniotic 
      fluid from the same human donor. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the use of ASA with a 
      fetal-derived bovine acellular dermal matrix to promote the healing of large, 
      acute, full-thickness wounds is evaluated. The authors herein hypothesize 
      treatment with ASA may allow for the healing of these wounds. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: This study consisted of a chart review of 33 patients, with an average 
      age of 42.2 years, and large acute wounds that were treated with a fetal-derived 
      bovine acellular dermal matrix adsorbed with ASA. To the best of the authors' 
      knowledge, this is the first study to date to investigate the usefulness of ASA 
      in wound healing for large, complex, acute wounds. RESULTS: In this study, 30 of 
      33 patients were confirmed as fully healed, and 3 patients were lost to 
      follow-up. The average wound size was 537.4 cm2, and the average time to 
      split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) was 30.5 days, with an average time of 6.8 
      days until at least 95% graft take was achieved. Of the patient population 
      studied, 45.5% had 1 or more significant comorbidities, 30.3% had wounds larger 
      than 500 cm2, and 39.4% had exposed bone or tendon. CONCLUSIONS: In a small but 
      challenging population including a high number of patients with comorbidities and 
      exposed bone or tendon, it was found that ASA delivery, along with a dermal 
      matrix, was successful in treating large, complex, acute wounds.

TI  - Retrospective Study on the Clinical Superiority of the Vacuum-Assisted Closure 
      System with a Silicon-based Dressing over the Conventional Tie-over Bolster 
      Technique in Skin Graft Fixation.
LID - 10.3390/medicina55120781 [doi]
LID - 781
AB  - Background and Objectives: The tie-over bolster technique has been conventionally 
      used for skin graft fixation; however, long operative times and postoperative 
      pain are the main disadvantages of this method. In this study, we introduce a new 
      method using vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) with a silicon-based dressing as an 
      alternative for skin graft fixation. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate 
      the clinical effect of the VAC plus silicon-based dressing method and the 
      conventional tie-over bolster technique for skin graft fixation in terms of pain, 
      operative time, and skin graft take rate. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients 
      who underwent skin graft surgery performed by a single surgeon from January 2017 
      to October 2018 were included in this clinical study. They were divided into two 
      groups based on the type of treatment: tie-over bolster technique and 
      vacuum-assisted closure (VAC), or silicon-based dressing groups. The operative 
      times were recorded twice (during suturing or stapling of the graft and during 
      removal of the dressing) in the two groups; similarly, pain was assessed using a 
      numeric rating scale (NRS) after surgery and during dressing removal. Skin graft 
      take rate was evaluated two weeks after dressing removal. Results: Twenty-six 
      patients who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled into the study and 
      assigned to one of the two groups (n = 13 each). No significant differences in 
      age, gender, and graft area were noted between the two groups of patients. The 
      VAC plus silicon-based dressing group demonstrated higher skin graft take rates 
      (p < 0.05), shorter operation times (p < 0.05), and lower levels of pain 
      (postoperative pain and pain during dressing removal) compared with the tie-over 
      bolster technique group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: These findings indicate that VAC 
      with silicon-based dressing can be used for skin graft fixation due to its 
      superior properties when compared with the conventional method, and can improve 
      the quality of life of patients undergoing skin graft fixation.

TI  - Pathogen Stimulation History Impacts Donor-Specific CD8(+) T Cell Susceptibility 
      to Costimulation/Integrin Blockade-Based Therapy.
PG  - 3081-94

AB  - Recent studies have shown that the quantity of donor-reactive memory T cells is 
      an important factor in determining the relative heterologous immunity barrier 
      posed during transplantation. Here, we hypothesized that the quality of T cell 
      memory also potently influences the response to costimulation blockade-based 
      immunosuppression. Using a murine skin graft model of CD8(+) memory T 
      cell-mediated costimulation blockade resistance, we elicited donor-reactive 
      memory T cells using three distinct types of pathogen infections. Strikingly, we 
      observed differential efficacy of a costimulation and integrin blockade regimen 
      based on the type of pathogen used to elicit the donor-reactive memory T cell 
      response. Intriguingly, the most immunosuppression-sensitive memory T cell 
      populations were composed primarily of central memory cells that possessed 
      greater recall potential, exhibited a less differentiated phenotype, and 
      contained more multi-cytokine producers. These data, therefore, demonstrate that 
      the memory T cell barrier is dependent on the specific type of pathogen infection 
      via which the donor-reactive memory T cells are elicited, and suggest that the 
      immune stimulation history of a given transplant patient may profoundly influence 
      the relative barrier posed by heterologous immunity during transplantation.

TI  - Engendering allograft ignorance in a mouse model of allogeneic skin 
      transplantation to the distal hind limb.
PG  - 611-8
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000000572 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to demonstrate lymphatic isolation in a 
      model of hind limb lymph node (LN) excision, consisting of ipsilateral popliteal 
      and inguinal LN excision and to evaluate the immunologic response to allogeneic 
      skin transplanted onto this region of lymphatic isolation. METHODS: To study 
      lymphatic flow, C57BL/6 mice underwent lymphadenectomy (n = 5), sham 
      lymphadenectomy (n = 5), or no intervention (n = 5), followed by methylene blue 
      injection. Mice were dissected to determine whether methylene blue traveled to 
      the iliac LN. To study host response to skin transplantation, C57BL/6 mice 
      underwent allogeneic skin transplantation with LN excision (n = 6), allogeneic 
      skin transplantation alone (n = 6), or syngeneic skin transplantation (n = 4). 
      Skin grafts were placed distal to the popliteal fossa and mice were euthanized at 
      day 10. Grafts were stained for endothelial cell and proliferation markers (CD31 
      and Ki67, respectively). Secondary lymphoid tissues (spleen, ipsilateral axillary 
      LN, and contralateral inguinal LN) were removed and rechallenged with BALB/c 
      alloantigen in vitro with subsequent assay of interferon-γ and interleukin 4 cell 
      expression using ELISPOT technique. RESULTS: Mice that underwent LN excision had 
      no evidence of methylene blue in the iliac nodes; mice without surgical 
      intervention or with sham LN excision consistently had methylene blue visible in 
      the ipsilateral iliac nodes. Mice treated with allogeneic skin transplantation 
      and LN excision had lower expression of interferon-γ and interleukin 4 in the 
      secondary lymphoid tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Lymph node excision completely 
      interrupts lymphatic flow of the hind limb. This model of lymphatic isolation 
      impairs the ability of the transplant recipient to acutely mount a Th1 or Th2 
      response to allogeneic skin transplants.

TI  - Administration of low doses of IL-2 combined to rapamycin promotes allogeneic 
      skin graft survival in mice.
PG  - 2874-82
LID - 10.1111/ajt.12944 [doi]
AB  - Human CD4(+) CD25(+) FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) prevent allogeneic graft 
      rejection by inhibiting T cell activation, as has been shown in mouse models. 
      Recently, low-dose IL-2 administration was shown to specifically activate Tregs 
      but not pathogenic conventional T cells, leading to resolution of type 1 diabetes 
      in nonobese diabetic mice. We therefore tested the ability of low-dose IL-2 to 
      prevent allogeneic skin graft rejection. We found that while IL-2 alone was 
      inefficient in preventing rejection, combined with rapamycin, IL-2 treatment 
      promoted skin graft survival both in minor disparate and semi-allogeneic skin 
      graft combinations. Tregs are activated by this combined treatment while 
      conventional CD4(+) cell expansion and activation are markedly inhibited. 
      Co-administration of anti-CD25 antibodies dramatically reduces the effect of the 
      IL-2/rapamycin treatment, strongly supporting a central role for Treg activation. 
      Thus, we provide the first preclinical data showing that low-dose IL-2 combined 
      with rapamycin can significantly delay transplant rejection in mice. These 
      findings may form the rational for clinical evaluation of this novel approach for 
      the prevention of transplant rejection.

TI  - Autologous dendritic cells prolong allograft survival through Tmem176b-dependent 
      antigen cross-presentation.
PG  - 1021-1031
LID - 10.1111/ajt.12708 [doi]
AB  - The administration of autologous (recipient-derived) tolerogenic dendritic cells 
      (ATDCs) is under clinical evaluation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which 
      these cells prolong graft survival in a donor-specific manner is unknown. Here, 
      we tested mouse ATDCs for their therapeutic potential in a skin transplantation 
      model. ATDC injection in combination with anti-CD3 treatment induced the 
      accumulation of CD8(+) CD11c(+) T cells and significantly prolonged allograft 
      survival. TMEM176B is an intracellular protein expressed in ATDCs and initially 
      identified in allograft tolerance. We show that Tmem176b(-/-) ATDCs completely 
      failed to trigger both phenomena but recovered their effect when loaded with 
      donor peptides before injection. These results strongly suggested that ATDCs 
      require TMEM176B to cross-present antigens in a tolerogenic fashion. In agreement 
      with this, Tmem176b(-/-) ATDCs specifically failed to cross-present male antigens 
      or ovalbumin to CD8(+) T cells. Finally, we observed that a Tmem176b-dependent 
      cation current controls phagosomal pH, a critical parameter in 
      cross-presentation. Thus, ATDCs require TMEM176B to cross-present donor antigens 
      to induce donor-specific CD8(+) CD11c(+) T cells with regulatory properties and 
      prolong graft survival.

TI  - Cutaneous Burn Injury Promotes Shifts in the Bacterial Microbiome in Autologous 
      Donor Skin: Implications for Skin Grafting Outcomes.
PG  - 441-448
LID - 10.1097/SHK.0000000000000874 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The cutaneous microbiome maintains skin barrier function, regulates 
      inflammation, and stimulates wound-healing responses. Burn injury promotes an 
      excessive activation of the cutaneous and systemic immune response directed 
      against commensal and invading pathogens. Skin grafting is the primary method of 
      reconstructing full-thickness burns, and wound infection continues to be a 
      significant complication. METHODS: In this study, the cutaneous bacterial 
      microbiome was evaluated and subsequently compared to patient outcomes. Three 
      different full-thickness skin specimens were assessed: control skin from 
      non-burned subjects; burn margin from burn patients; and autologous donor skin 
      from the same cohort of burn patients. RESULTS: We observed that skin bacterial 
      community structure of burn patients was significantly altered compared with 
      control patients. We determined that the unburned autologous donor skin from burn 
      patients exhibits a microbiome similar to that of the burn margin, rather than 
      unburned controls, and that changes in the cutaneous microbiome statistically 
      correlate with several post-burn complications. We established that 
      Corynebacterium positively correlated with burn wound infection, while 
      Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium negatively correlated with burn wound 
      infection. Both Corynebacterium and Enterococcus negatively correlated with the 
      development of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies distinct differences in 
      the cutaneous microbiome between burn subjects and unburned controls, and 
      ascertains that select bacterial taxa significantly correlate with several 
      comorbid complications of burn injury. These preliminary data suggest that 
      grafting donor skin exhibiting bacterial dysbiosis may augment infection and/or 
      graft failure and sets the foundation for more in-depth and mechanistic analyses 
      in presumably "healthy" donor skin from patients requiring skin grafting 
      procedures.

      skin allograft survival.
PG  - 641-56

AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are the major specialized antigen-presenting cells for the 
      development of optimal T-cell immunity. DCs can be used as pharmacological 
      targets to monitor novel biological modifiers for the cure of harmful immune 
      responses, such as transplantation rejection. Dryopteris crassirhizoma Nakai 
      (Aspiadaceae) is used for traditional herbal medicine in the region of East Asia. 
      The root of this fern plant has been listed for treating inflammatory diseases. 
      Dryocrassin is the tetrameric phlorophenone component derived from Dryopteris. 
      Here we tested the immunomodulatory potential of dryocrassin on 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated activation of mouse bone marrow-derived DCs 
      in vitro and in skin allograft transplantation in vivo. Results demonstrated that 
      dryocrassin reduced the emission of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and 
      interleukin-12p70 by LPS-stimulated DCs. The expression of LPS-induced major 
      histocompatibility complex class II, CD40, and CD86 on DCs was also blocked by 
      dryocrassin. Moreover, LPS-stimulated DC-elicited allogeneic T-cell proliferation 
      was alleviated by dryocrassin. In addition, dryocrassin inhibited LPS-induced 
      activation of IκB kinase, JNK/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the 
      translocation of NF-κB. Treatment with dryocrassin noticeably diminished 
      2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene-reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity and extended 
      skin allograft survival. Dryocrassin may be one of the potent immunosuppressive 
      agents for transplant rejection via the destruction of DC maturation and 
      function.

      flap.
PG  - 402-4
LID - 10.5505/tjtes.2015.49386 [doi]
AB  - Caustic chemicals cause destruction in tissues even long after the initial 
      exposure. This study reported a case of recurrent graft lysis encountered 
      throughout the treatment of a sodium hydroxide burn. A caustic burn on the ankle 
      of a patient was reconstructed with split thickness skin grafts thrice in a 
      period of four months. The burn site healed uneventfully after each skin 
      grafting. However, weeks after each successful graft take, even though the 
      patient did not experience any trauma at his operated ankle, an eczematous 
      blistering at the skin graft site was observed. Thereafter, skin grafts almost 
      totally sloughed over time even after each successful graft take. Six months 
      after the initial burn and recurrent skin graft lysis, the defect site was 
      reconstructed with medial plantar flap. At the postoperative ninth month 
      follow-up, there was no sign of the blistering or skin loss at the burn area 
      after definitive flap surgery. Recurrent graft lysis, in a few weeks after total 
      skin graft take is an unusual complication for most of the burn cases. Caustic 
      burns may have a deceptively superficial appearance concealing the chemical 
      reactions that further damage the tissue. Therefore, early surgical interventions 
      such as deep debridement and graft surgery should be kept in mind as primary 
      treatment options.

TI  - The Application of Digital Design Combined with 3D Printing Technology in Skin 
      Flap Transplantation for Fingertip Defects during the COVID-19 Epidemic.
PG  - 5554500

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the advantages of preoperative digital design of 
      skin flaps to repair fingertip defects during the COVID-19 pandemic. We combined 
      digital design with a 3D-printed model of the affected finger for preoperative 
      communication with fingertip defect patients under observation in a buffer ward. 
      METHODS: From December 2019 to January 2021, we obtained data from 25 cases of 30 
      fingertip defects in 15 males and 10 females, aged 20-65 years old (mean 35 ± 5 
      years). All cases were treated by digitally designing preoperative fingertip 
      defect flaps combined with a 3D-printed model. Preoperative 3D Systems Sense 
      scanning was routinely performed, 3-matic 12.0 was used to measure the fingertip 
      defect area ranging from 1.5 cm × 3.5 cm to 2.0 cm × 5.0 cm, and the skin flap 
      was designed. The flap area was 1.6 cm × 3.6 cm to 2.1 cm × 5.1 cm. CURA 15.02.1 
      was used to set parameters, and the 3D model of the affected finger was printed 
      prior to the operation. Full-thickness skin grafts were taken from donor areas 
      for repair. RESULTS: No vascular crises occurred in any of the 25 cases, and all 
      flaps survived. The postoperative follow-up occurred over 3-12 months. All 
      patients were evaluated 3 months after operation according to the trial standard 
      of hand function evaluation of the Chinese Hand Surgery Society. The results 
      showed that 20 cases had excellent outcomes (80%), four cases had good outcomes 
      (16%), and one case had a fair outcome (4%). The excellent and good rate was 96%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 epidemic, fingertip defects were treated with 
      preoperative digital design of fingertip defect flaps combined with 3D printing. 
      Precision design saves surgery time and improves the success rate of surgery and 
      the survival rates of skin flaps. In addition, 3D model simulations improve 
      preoperative communication efficiency, and the personalized design improves 
      patient satisfaction.

AB  - Acute graft- vs. -host disease (GVHD) is an important cause of morbidity and 
      death after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We identify a 
      new approach to prevent GVHD that impairs monocyte-derived dendritic cell (moDC) 
      alloactivation of T cells, yet preserves graft- vs.-leukemia (GVL). Exceeding 
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) capacity results in a spliced form of X-box binding 
      protein-1 (XBP-1s). XBP-1s mediates ER stress and inflammatory responses. We 
      demonstrate that siRNA targeting XBP-1 in moDCs abrogates their stimulation of 
      allogeneic T cells. B-I09, an inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α) inhibitor that 
      prevents XBP-1 splicing, reduces human moDC migration, allo-stimulatory potency, 
      and curtails moDC IL-1β, TGFβ, and p40 cytokines, suppressing Th1 and Th17 cell 
      priming. B-I09-treated moDCs reduce responder T cell activation via calcium flux 
      without interfering with regulatory T cell (Treg) function or GVL effects by 
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and NK cells. In a human T cell mediated xenogeneic 
      GVHD model, B-I09 inhibition of XBP-1s reduced target-organ damage and pathogenic 
      Th1 and Th17 cells without impacting donor Tregs or anti-tumor CTL. DC XBP-1s 
      inhibition provides an innovative strategy to prevent GVHD and retain GVL.

TI  - The increasing role of epidermal grafting utilizing a novel harvesting system in 
      chronic wounds.
PG  - 26-30
AB  - Skin grafting techniques range from harvesting full-thickness to split-thickness 
      grafts to grafts containing only epidermis. All of these autologous tissues have 
      their place on the reconstructive ladder. However, the use of full-thickness and 
      split-thickness grafts as coverage over chronic wounds remains limited by a 
      number of factors, including the need for anesthesia, a surgically trained 
      physician, and an operating room in which to perform the procedure; pain and 
      damage associated with the donor site; and severe patient comorbidities. 
      Epidermal grafting offers an option for autografts and uses only a minimal amount 
      of superficial epidermis from the donor site. Although successful use of 
      epidermal grafting has been reported in pigmentation disorders, as well as burns 
      and chronic wounds, previous harvesting methods have been described as cumbersome 
      and time consuming. An automated epidermal harvesting system is now commercially 
      available and involves a tool that applies both heat and suction concurrently to 
      normal skin to induce epidermal micrograft formation. The new tool allows quick 
      harvest and transfer of the epidermal micrografts at the bedside without 
      anesthesia, with minimal donor site healing time and patient discomfort. The use 
      of epidermal grafts in chronic wounds and the harvesting technique are reviewed 
      here.

TI  - Prolonged Allograft Survival in a Patient With Chronic Immunosuppression: A Case 
      Report and Systematic Review.
PG  - 159-162
AB  - A 41-year-old man with past medical history of kidney-liver transplantation 
      requiring chronic immunosuppression presented 2 years posttransplant with a 
      necrotizing soft tissue infection of his right thigh. Serial debridement to 
      remove necrotic tissue was performed, and a Matrix HD Allograft Fenestrated (RTI 
      Surgical, Alachua, FL) was applied. At 5-months post grafting, the patient 
      demonstrated fully vascularized and intact skin. Under normal circumstances, a 
      cadaveric allograft sloughs over several weeks and is not usually considered a 
      permanent solution for wound closure. A systematic review of transplant patients 
      on chronic immunosuppression with skin allografts demonstrates the potential for 
      the indefinite survival of an allograft. Necrotizing soft tissue infections can 
      definitively be treated using serial debridement and allograft transplantation in 
      the chronically immunosuppressed.

TI  - Survival of human cadaver skin on severe combined immune deficiency pigs: Proof 
      of concept.
PG  - 426-430
LID - 10.1111/wrr.12715 [doi]
AB  - Transplantation of human xenografts onto immunocompromised mice is a powerful 
      research tool for studying wound healing. However, differences in healing between 
      humans and mice and their small size limit this model. We determined whether 
      human cadaver skin xenografts transplanted onto pigs with severe combined immune 
      deficiency (SCID) would survive and not be rejected. Meshed (1:1.5), 
      cryopreserved human cadaver skin was transplanted onto 10 partial thickness 
      dermatome wounds in each of two normal domestic pigs and two SCID pigs. 
      Autografts (n = 2/animal) from the four animals were used as controls. In normal 
      pigs, all autografts were engrafted and healed with a minimal, if any, 
      inflammation and scarring. All human xenografts were rejected by the normal pigs 
      within 5-11 days and associated with an intense T-cell inflammatory response. In 
      contrast, both autografts and xenografts were engrafted and survived the 28-day 
      study in the SCID pigs with a minimal inflammation and no gross scarring.

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology can be used to engineer the antigen 
      specificity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and improve their potency as an 
      adoptive cell therapy in multiple disease models. As synthetic receptors, CARs 
      carry the risk of immunogenicity, particularly when derived from nonhuman 
      antibodies. Using an HLA-A*02:01-specific CAR (A2-CAR) encoding a single-chain 
      variable fragment (Fv) derived from a mouse antibody, we developed a panel of 20 
      humanized A2-CARs (hA2-CARs). Systematic testing demonstrated variations in 
      expression, and ability to bind HLA-A*02:01 and stimulate human Treg suppression 
      in vitro. In addition, we developed a new method to comprehensively map the 
      alloantigen specificity of CARs, revealing that humanization reduced HLA-A 
      cross-reactivity. In vivo bioluminescence imaging showed rapid trafficking and 
      persistence of hA2-CAR Tregs in A2-expressing allografts, with eventual migration 
      to draining lymph nodes. Adoptive transfer of hA2-CAR Tregs suppressed HLA-A2+ 
      cell-mediated xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease and diminished rejection of 
      human HLA-A2+ skin allografts. These data provide a platform for systematic 
      development and specificity testing of humanized alloantigen-specific CARs that 
      can be used to engineer specificity and homing of therapeutic Tregs.

TI  - The impact of CD160 deficiency on alloreactive CD8 T cell responses and allograft 
      rejection.
PG  - 103-123

AB  - CD160 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily with a pattern of expression 
      mainly restricted to cytotoxic cells. To assess the functional relevance of the 
      HVEM/CD160 signaling pathway in allogeneic cytotoxic responses, exon 2 of the 
      CD160 gene was targeted by CRISPR/Cas9 to generate CD160 deficient mice. Next, we 
      evaluated the impact of CD160 deficiency in the course of an alloreactive 
      response. To that aim, parental donor WT (wild-type) or CD160 KO (knock-out) T 
      cells were adoptively transferred into non-irradiated semiallogeneic F1 
      recipients, in which donor alloreactive CD160 KO CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells 
      clonally expanded less vigorously than in WT T cell counterparts. This 
      differential proliferative response rate at the early phase of T cell expansion 
      influenced the course of CD8 T cell differentiation and the composition of the 
      effector T cell pool that led to a significant decreased of the memory precursor 
      effector cells (MPECs) / short-lived effector cells (SLECs) ratio in CD160 KO CD8 
      T cells compared to WT CD8 T cells. Despite these differences in T cell 
      proliferation and differentiation, allogeneic MHC class I mismatched (bm1) skin 
      allograft survival in CD160 KO recipients was comparable to that of WT 
      recipients. However, the administration of CTLA-4.Ig showed an enhanced survival 
      trend of bm1 skin allografts in CD160 KO with respect to WT recipients. Finally, 
      CD160 deficient NK cells were as proficient as CD160 WT NK cells in rejecting 
      allogeneic cellular allografts or MHC class I deficient tumor cells. CD160 may 
      represent a CD28 alternative costimulatory molecule for the modulation of 
      allogeneic CD8 T cell responses either in combination with costimulation blockade 
      or by direct targeting of alloreactive CD8 T cells that upregulate CD160 
      expression in response to alloantigen stimulation.

TI  - DNA Vaccine Encoding HPV16 Oncogenes E6 and E7 Induces Potent Cell-mediated and 
      Humoral Immunity Which Protects in Tumor Challenge and Drives E7-expressing Skin 
      Graft Rejection.
PG  - 62-70

AB  - We have previously shown that a novel DNA vaccine technology of codon 
      optimization and the addition of ubiquitin sequences enhanced immunogenicity of a 
      herpes simplex virus 2 polynucleotide vaccine in mice, and induced cell-mediated 
      immunity when administered in humans at relatively low doses of naked DNA. We 
      here show that a new polynucleotide vaccine using the same technology and 
      encoding a fusion protein of the E6 and E7 oncogenes of high-risk human 
      papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is immunogenic in mice. This vaccine induces 
      long-lasting humoral and cell-mediated immunity and protects mice from 
      establishment of HPV16-E7-expressing tumors. In addition, it suppresses growth of 
      readily established tumors and shows enhanced efficacy when combined with immune 
      checkpoint blockade targeted at PD-L1. This vaccine also facilitates rejection of 
      HPV16-E7-expressing skin grafts that demonstrate epidermal hyperplasia with 
      characteristics of cervical and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. Clinical 
      studies evaluating the efficacy of this vaccine in patients with HPV16 
      premalignancies are planned.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate if previous findings on the association between 
      dressing treatments and subjective opinion on final donor site scar outcome using 
      the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) can be confirmed 
      objectively. The previous study showed that patients dressed with hydrofiber 
      covered with film were more satisfied with their donor site scars than patients 
      receiving porcine xenograft or polyurethane foam dressings. METHODS: Scar outcome 
      measurements were assessed by a blinded observer using POSAS and the Cutometer 
      dual MPA 580 device to measure the viscoelasticity of skin. RESULTS: A total of 
      17 participants were included in this study, five of whom were treated with 
      hydrofiber, six with polyurethane foam, and another six with porcine xenograft. 
      There were no significant differences among groups in any of the POSAS items or 
      in the viscoelasticity measurements made with the Cutometer. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      investigators could not confirm previous associations between dressing treatment 
      and long-term donor site scars. No associations between donor sites' healing 
      times and final scarring were found. Hypopigmentation was reported in 15 of 17 
      donor sites evaluated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The biological recovery of human skin allografts is the gold standard 
      for preservation in Skin Banks. However, there is no worldwide consensus about 
      specific allocation criteria for preserved human skin allografts with living 
      cells. A report is presented on the results of 5 years of experience of using 
      human skin allografts in burned patient in the Skin and Tissue Bank at the 
      "Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitacion" MATERIAL AND METHODS: The human skin 
      allografts were obtained from multi-organ donors. processed and preserved at -80 
      °C for 12 months. Allocation criteria were performed according to blood type 
      match, clinical history, and burned body surface. RESULTS: Up to now, the Skin 
      and Tissue Bank at 'Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitacion" has processed and 
      recovered 125,000 cm(2) of human skin allografts. It has performed 34 surgical 
      implants on 21 burned patients. The average of burn body surface was 59.2%. More 
      than two-thirds (67.7%) of recipients of skin allografts were matched of the same 
      to type blood of the donor, and 66.6% survived after 126 days hospital stay. 
      CONCLUSION: It is proposed to consider recipient's blood group as allocation 
      criteria to assign tissue; and use human skin allografts on patiens affected with 
      burns over 30% of body surface (according the "rule of the 9").

TI  - The Incompatibility of Living Systems: Characterizing Growth-Induced 
      Incompatibilities in Expanded Skin.
PG  - 1734-52

AB  - Skin expansion is a common surgical technique to correct large cutaneous defects. 
      Selecting a successful expansion protocol is solely based on the experience and 
      personal preference of the operating surgeon. Skin expansion could be improved by 
      predictive computational simulations. Towards this goal, we model skin expansion 
      using the continuum framework of finite growth. This approach crucially relies on 
      the concept of incompatible configurations. However, aside from the classical 
      opening angle experiment, our current understanding of growth-induced 
      incompatibilities remains rather vague. Here we visualize and characterize 
      incompatibilities in living systems using skin expansion in a porcine model: We 
      implanted and inflated two expanders, crescent, and spherical, and filled them to 
      225 cc throughout a period of 21 days. To quantify the residual strains developed 
      during this period, we excised the expanded skin patches and subdivided them into 
      smaller pieces. Skin growth averaged 1.17 times the original area for the 
      spherical and 1.10 for the crescent expander, and displayed significant regional 
      variations. When subdivided into smaller pieces, the grown skin patches retracted 
      heterogeneously and confirmed the existence of incompatibilities. Understanding 
      skin growth through mechanical stretch will allow surgeons to improve-and 
      ultimately personalize-preoperative treatment planning in plastic and 
      reconstructive surgery.

TI  - Late failure of a split-thickness skin graft in the setting of homozygous factor 
      V Leiden mutation: a case report and correlative animal model from the Wound 
      Etiology and Healing (WE-HEAL) study.
PG  - 537-44
LID - 10.1111/iwj.12156 [doi]
AB  - We present the case of a 53-year-old Caucasian male smoker with remote history of 
      left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and a strong family history of 
      thrombosis, who presented to the Center for Wound Healing at MedStar Georgetown 
      University Hospital with spontaneous left leg ulceration. Prothrombotic 
      evaluation showed homozygosity for the factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation. 
      Therapeutic anticoagulation was commenced with warfarin (Coumadin®) and the 
      patient underwent successful debridement and Apligraf® followed by 
      split-thickness skin graft (STSG) of two wounds. He had an uneventful 
      postoperative course and on the 27th postoperative day the grafts were 95% 
      intact. However, by postoperative day 41 there was 10% graft loss, and over the 
      subsequent 2 weeks both grafts necrosed. On further questioning, it transpired 
      that the patient had discontinued his warfarin on postoperative day 37 because he 
      thought that it was no longer necessary. The patient is enrolled in the Wound 
      Etiology and Healing (WE-HEAL) study, and at the time of the original graft, 
      residual skin fragments from the STSG were transplanted onto a nude mouse for 
      development of an animal model of wound healing. The mouse graft was successful 
      and was harvested at postoperative day 87 for pathological examination. We review 
      the mechanisms by which prothrombotic states, particularly FVL mutation, can 
      contribute to skin graft failure and delayed wound healing. This case highlights 
      the importance of considering prothrombotic conditions in patients with 
      spontaneous leg ulcerations and the impact of therapeutic anticoagulation on 
      healing. It further allows us to demonstrate the efficacy of the animal model in 
      which residual fragments of STSG tissue are utilised for transplant onto nude 
      mice for manipulation in the laboratory.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Regenerative Epithelial Suspension (RES), on the pigmentation 
      of split-thickness skin graft donor sites in children: the dRESsing pilot 
      randomised controlled trial protocol.
PG  - e077525

LID - e077525
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric donor site wounds are often complicated by dyspigmentation 
      following a split-thickness skin graft. These easily identifiable scars can 
      potentially never return to normal pigmentation. A Regenerative Epidermal 
      Suspension (RES) has been shown to improve pigmentation in patients with 
      vitiligo, and in adult patients following a burn injury. Very little is known 
      regarding the efficacy of RES for the management of donor site scars in children. 
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A pilot randomised controlled trial of 40 children 
      allocated to two groups (RES or no RES) standard dressing applied to donor site 
      wounds will be conducted. All children aged 16 years or younger requiring a split 
      thickness skin graft will be screened for eligibility. The primary outcome is 
      donor site scar pigmentation 12 months after skin grafting. Secondary outcomes 
      include re-epithelialisation time, pain, itch, dressing application ease, 
      treatment satisfaction, scar thickness and health-related quality of life. 
      Commencing 7 days after the skin graft, the dressing will be changed every 
      3-5 days until the donor site is ≥ 95% re-epithelialised. Data will be collected 
      at each dressing change and 3, 6 and 12 months post skin graft. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was confirmed on 11 February 2019 by the study 
      site Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) (HREC/18/QCHQ/45807). Study findings 
      will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and 
      international conferences. This study was prospectively registered on the 
      Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (available at 
      https://anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12620000227998.aspx). TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Aged B cells alter immune regulation of allografts in mice.
PG  - 2650-2658
LID - 10.1002/eji.201646353 [doi]
AB  - Organ transplantation in older people is increasing, but how aging impacts B-cell 
      responses to organ transplantation is still unknown. Here, we show that the 
      depletion of B cells with anti-CD20 antibodies has disparate effects depending on 
      recipient age. In young murine recipients, anti-CD20 treatment impaired the 
      ability of immune modulation to extend skin allograft survival. In contrast, 
      anti-CD20 treatment extended allograft survival in aged recipients treated with 
      immune modulation. Although regulatory B-cell function and the numbers of 
      marginal and follicular B cells were similar between age groups, a subpopulation 
      of B cells, termed age-associated B cells (ABCs), accumulated upon aging. ABCs 
      isolated from aged mice exhibited upregulation of CD73, CD80, CD106, and TLR2 and 
      an increased capacity to augment T-cell alloimmunity compared to ABCs from young 
      mice. Importantly, ABCs from aged, but not young, mice impaired the ability of 
      immune modulation to enhance allograft survival after adoptive transfer into 
      young transplant recipients. Our study indicates that ABCs impair the immune 
      regulation of allografts. Thus, recipient age needs to be considered when 
      proposing B-cell-depleting immune therapy.

TI  - Addition of platelet concentrate to dermo-epidermal skin graft in deep burn 
      trauma reduces scarring and need for revision surgeries.
PG  - 242-58
LID - 10.5507/bp.2013.070 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: [corrected] Deep skin burn injuries, especially those on the face, 
      hands, feet, genitalia and perineum represent significant therapeutic challenges. 
      Autologous dermo-epidermal skin grafts (DESG) have become standard of care for 
      treating deep burns. Additionally, human autologous thrombin activated autologous 
      platelet concentrate (APC) has gained acceptance in the setting of wounds. While 
      each of these interventions has been independently shown to accelerate healing, 
      the combination of the two has never been evaluated. We hypothesized that the 
      addition of platelets (source of growth factors and inhibitors necessary for 
      tissue repair) to the DESG (source of progenitor cells and of tissue proteases 
      necessary for spatial and temporal control of growth regulators released from 
      platelets) would create the optimal environment for the reciprocal interaction of 
      cells within the healing tissues. METHODS: We used clinical examination (digital 
      photography), standardised scales for evaluating pain and scarring, in 
      combination with blood perfusion (laser Doppler imaging), as well as molecular 
      and laboratory analyses. RESULTS: We show for the first time that the combination 
      of APC and DESG leads to earlier relief of pain, and decreased use of analgesics, 
      antipruritics and orthotic devices. Most importantly, this treatment is 
      associated with earlier discharges from hospital and significant cost savings. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that DESG engraftment is facilitated by the 
      local addition of platelets and by systemic thrombocytosis. This local 
      interaction leads to the physiological revascularization at 1-3 months. We 
      observed significant elevation of circulating platelets in early stages of 
      engraftment (1-7 days), which normalized over the subsequent 7 and 90 days.

AB  - Immune cells are equipped with a number of receptors that recognize sterile 
      injury and pathogens. We find that host immune cells release ATP as an 
      inflammatory signal in response to allogeneic transplantation. ATP then acts via 
      a feedback mechanism on the P2X7 channel to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and 
      subsequently process and release interleukin (IL)-18. This process is a necessary 
      stage in the deleterious Th1 response against allotransplantation via 
      interferon-γ production. Lack of IL-18 resulted in a decrease in 
      graft-infiltrating CD8 cells but an increase in regulatory T cells. In human 
      liver transplant patients undergoing progressive immunosuppressive drug 
      withdrawal, we found that patients experiencing acute rejection had higher levels 
      of the P2X7 receptor in circulating inflammatory monocytes compared to tolerant 
      patients. These data suggest that the pharmacological inhibition of the P2X7 
      receptor or the NLRP3 inflammasome will aid in inducing transplant tolerance 
      without complete immunoparalysis.

LID - 576651
AB  - Strategies targeting T cells are the cornerstone of immunosuppression after solid 
      organ transplantation. The transcription factor NF-κB is a key regulator of 
      downstream T-cell activation and induction of inflammatory mediators; its full 
      activation via antigen receptor engagement requires both the scaffold and the 
      protease activity of the paracaspase Malt1. Experimental studies have highlighted 
      that Malt1-deficient mice were resistant to experimental autoimmune 
      encephalomyelitis, although they lacked peripheral regulatory T cells (Treg). 
      Here, we compared targeting Malt1 versus using calcineurin inhibitors as 
      immunosuppression in a stringent experimental transplantation model. We found 
      that Malt1-deficiency impaired Th1-mediated alloresponses in vitro and in vivo 
      and significantly prolonged MHC-mismatched skin allograft survival, compared to 
      cyclosporine. However, it paradoxically enhanced Th17 differentiation in the 
      transplantation setting. Interestingly, more selective inhibition of Malt1 
      protease activity in wild-type mouse and human peripheral T cells in vitro led to 
      attenuation of alloreactive Th1 cells, while preserving preexisting Treg in the 
      peripheral T-cell pool, and without promoting Th17 differentiation. Thus, there 
      is a place for further investigation of the role of Malt1 signaling in the 
      setting of transplantation.

TI  - Fox Den Disease: An Interesting Case Following Delayed Diagnosis.
PG  - 170-3
AB  - Pyoderma fistulans sinifica, also known as fox den disease, is a rare and poorly 
      understood inflammatory disorder of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. This 
      disorder is often mistaken for other inflammatory skin disorders and treated 
      inappropriately. The authors describe the case of a 53-year-old male who 
      presented to the colorectal surgery service with a longstanding diagnosis of 
      perirectal Crohn's disease. Despite aggressive immunosuppression and numerous 
      surgical procedures, the patient continued to have unrelenting purulent drainage 
      from the skin of his buttocks. Following wide excision of the affected skin and 
      subcutaneous tissues by the colorectal surgeon, the plastic surgery team 
      reconstructed the 30 cm x 55 cm wound using a combination of local flaps and skin 
      grafts. The initial pathology report of the excised specimen confirmed the 
      presence of nonspecific abscesses and inflammation. Upon special request by the 
      plastic surgery team, the sample was resectioned with the specific intent of 
      establishing a diagnosis of fox den disease. The additional slides met the 
      criteria for an unequivocal diagnosis of fox den disease. Immunosuppression was 
      discontinued and the patient healed his wounds without complication. Fox den 
      disease is often overlooked because of the obscurity of the disease and the 
      special histological sectioning needed to establish a diagnosis. In this case, 
      the patient was unnecessarily treated with immunosuppressive drugs for more than 
      3 decades because of a misdiagnosis. With increased awareness of fox den disease, 
      perhaps its pathophysiology can be better elucidated as more patients are 
      appropriately diagnosed and treated.

AB  - Interleukin-33 (IL-33) has been a focus of study because of its variety of 
      functions shaping CD4(+) T-cell biology. In the present work, we evaluated the 
      modulatory effect of IL-33 on suppressor cells in an in vivo transplantation 
      model. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were grafted with syngeneic or allogeneic skin 
      transplants and treated with exogenous IL-33 daily. After 10 days of treatment, 
      we analysed draining lymph node cellularity and found in allogeneic animals an 
      increment in myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which co-express MHC-II, and 
      become enriched upon IL-33 treatment. In line with this observation, inducible 
      nitric oxide synthase and arginase 1 expression were also increased in allogeneic 
      animals upon IL-33 administration. In addition, IL-33 treatment up-regulated the 
      number of Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells in the allogeneic group, 
      complementing the healthier integrity of the allografts and the increased 
      allograft survival. Moreover, we demonstrate that IL-33 promotes CD4(+) T-cell 
      expansion and conversion of CD4(+)  Foxp3(-) T cells into CD4(+)  Foxp3(+) Treg 
      cells in the periphery. Lastly, the cytokine pattern of ex vivo-stimulated 
      draining lymph nodes indicates that IL-33 dampens interferon-γ and IL-17 
      production, stimulating IL-10 secretion. Altogether, our work complements 
      previous studies on the immune-modulatory activity of IL-33, showing that this 
      cytokine affects myeloid-derived suppressor cells at the cell number and gene 
      expression levels. More importantly, our research demonstrates for the first time 
      that IL-33 allows for in vivo Foxp3(+) Treg cell conversion and favours an 
      anti-inflammatory or tolerogenic state by skewing cytokine production. Therefore, 
      our data suggest a potential use of IL-33 to prevent allograft rejection, 
      bringing new therapeutics to the transplantation field.

TI  - DEPTOR modulates activation responses in CD4(+) T cells and enhances 
      immunoregulation following transplantation.
PG  - 77-88
LID - 10.1111/ajt.14995 [doi]
AB  - DEPTOR is an evolutionarily conserved cell-intrinsic binding partner of mTOR that 
      functions as a negative regulator of signaling responses. In this study, we show 
      that DEPTOR is expressed within CD4(+) T cells, and we observed that its relative 
      level of expression modulates differentiation as well as glucose utilization 
      within CD4(+) T effectors in vitro. Using knock-in mice, we also find that 
      induced expression of DEPTOR within CD4(+) T regulatory cells stabilizes Foxp3 
      expression, shifts metabolism toward oxidative phosphorylation, and increases 
      survival and suppressive function. In vivo, fully MHC mismatched cardiac 
      allograft survival is significantly prolonged in knock-in recipients and 
      sustained recipient expression of DEPTOR in combination with costimulatory 
      blockade induces long-term graft survival. Furthermore, we show that the induced 
      expression of DEPTOR in CD4(+) T effectors fails to inhibit acute allograft 
      rejection. Rather, prolonged survival is dominantly mediated via induced 
      expression and function of DEPTOR within recipient CD4(+) T regulatory cells. 
      These collective findings identify DEPTOR as a novel protein that functions in 
      CD4(+) T cells to augment immunoregulation in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - 2B4 Mediates Inhibition of CD8(+) T Cell Responses via Attenuation of Glycolysis 
      and Cell Division.
PG  - 1536-1548
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1701240 [doi]
AB  - We recently showed that 2B4 expression on memory T cells in human renal 
      transplant recipients was associated with reduced rates of rejection. To 
      investigate whether 2B4 functionally underlies graft acceptance during 
      transplantation, we established an experimental model in which 2B4 was 
      retrogenically expressed on donor-reactive murine CD8(+) T cells (2B4rg), which 
      were then transferred into naive recipients prior to skin transplantation. We 
      found that constitutive 2B4 expression resulted in significantly reduced 
      accumulation of donor-reactive CD8(+) T cells following transplantation and 
      significantly prolonged graft survival following transplantation. This marked 
      reduction in alloreactivity was due to reduced proliferation of CD8(+) Thy1.1(+) 
      2B4rg cells as compared with control cells, underpinned by extracellular flux 
      analyses demonstrating that 2B4-deficient (2B4KO) CD8(+) cells activated in vitro 
      exhibited increased glycolytic capacity and upregulation of gene expression 
      profiles consistent with enhanced glycolytic machinery as compared with wild type 
      controls. Furthermore, 2B4KO CD8(+) T cells primed in vivo exhibited 
      significantly enhanced ex vivo uptake of a fluorescent glucose analogue. Finally, 
      the proliferative advantage associated with 2B4 deficiency was only observed in 
      the setting of glucose sufficiency; in glucose-poor conditions, 2B4KO CD8(+) T 
      cells lost their proliferative advantage. Together, these data indicate that 2B4 
      signals function to alter T cell glucose metabolism, thereby limiting the 
      proliferation and accumulation of CD8(+) T cells. Targeting 2B4 may therefore 
      represent a novel therapeutic strategy to attenuate unwanted CD8(+) T cell 
      responses.

AB  - The thymus plays a significant role in establishing immunological self-tolerance. 
      Previous studies have revealed that host immune reaction to allogeneic 
      transplants could be regulated by thymus transplantation. However, physiological 
      thymus involution hinders the clinical application of these insights. Here, we 
      report an efficient generation of thymic epithelial-like tissue derived from 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and its potential to regulate immune 
      reaction in allogeneic transplantation. We established an iPSC line which 
      constitutively expresses mouse Foxn1 gene and examined the effect of its 
      expression during in vitro differentiation of thymic epithelial cells (TECs). We 
      found that Foxn1 expression enhances the differentiation induction of cells 
      expressing TEC-related cell surface molecules along with upregulation of 
      endogenous Foxn1. iPSC-derived TECs (iPSC-TECs) generated T cells in nude 
      recipient mice after renal subcapsular transplantation. Moreover, iPSC-TEC 
      transplantation to immuno-competent recipients significantly prolonged the 
      survival of allogeneic skin. Our study provides a novel concept for allogeneic 
      transplantation in the setting of regenerative medicine.

      not prevent allograft rejection.

AB  - Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play an important role in host anti-donor 
      responses to transplanted tissue. A key trigger of the host alloresponse involves 
      recognition of foreign antigen presented on activated antigen presenting cells by 
      the host T cells. Emerging data suggest that PRR blockade can abrogate host 
      anti-donor responses by interfering with activation of antigen presenting cells, 
      particularly activation of dendritic cells. Our study asked whether blockade of a 
      well-characterized family of intracellular PRRs, the NOD family, interfered with 
      alloantigen recognition and allograft rejection. We found that deletion of either 
      NOD1 or NOD2 in antigen presenting cells (APCs) had no effect on induction of T 
      cell proliferation to alloantigen, but that simultaneous deletion of NOD1 and 
      NOD2 significantly inhibited T cell responses. There was however no effect of the 
      NOD deletion on skin graft rejection when NOD1×NOD2 skin was transplanted onto 
      allogeneic hosts or when WT skin was transplanted onto NOD1×NOD2 deficient 
      recipients. The conclusion of this study is that in vitro alloresponses are 
      negatively impacted by the simultaneous deletion of NOD1 and NOD2, but that 
      allograft rejection across a stringent allo barrier is not affected. Our results 
      suggest that the NOD family members, NOD1 and NOD2, play a collaborative role in 
      T cell activation by alloantigen and that their blockade in vitro can inhibit T 
      cell responses.

TI  - BAFF Inhibition Effectively Suppresses the Development of Anti-HLA.A2 Antibody in 
      the Highly Sensitized Mouse Model.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22020861 [doi]
LID - 861
AB  - B cell activating factor (BAFF) is a cytokine that plays a role in the survival, 
      proliferation and differentiation of B cells. We proposed to observe the effects 
      of BAFF inhibition on the humoral immune responses of an allosensitized mouse 
      model using HLA.A2 transgenic mice. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were sensitized with 
      skin allografts from C57BL/6-Tg (HLA-A2.1)1Enge/J mice and were treated with 
      anti-BAFF monoclonal antibody (mAb) (named Sandy-2) or control IgG1 antibody. 
      HLA.A2-specific IgG was reduced in BAFF-inhibited mice compared to the control 
      group (Δ-13.62 vs. Δ27.07, p < 0.05). BAFF inhibition also resulted in increased 
      pre-pro and immature B cell proportions and decreased mature B cells in the bone 
      marrow (p < 0.05 vs. control). In the spleen, an increase in transitional B cells 
      was observed with a significant decrease in marginal and follicular B cells (p < 
      0.05 vs. control). There was no significant difference in the proportions of 
      long-lived plasma and memory B cells. Microarray analysis showed that 19 gene 
      probes were significantly up- (>2-fold, p < 0.05) or down-regulated (≤2-fold, p < 
      0.05) in the BAFF-inhibited group. BAFF inhibition successfully reduced 
      alloimmune responses through the reduction in alloantibody production and 
      suppression of B cell differentiation and maturation. Our data suggest that BAFF 
      suppression may serve as a useful target in desensitization therapy.

TI  - Propranolol attenuates hemorrhage and accelerates wound healing in severely 
      burned adults.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Propranolol, a nonselective β-blocker, exerts an indirect effect on 
      the vasculature by leaving α-adrenergic receptors unopposed, resulting in 
      peripheral vasoconstriction. We have previously shown that propranolol diminishes 
      peripheral blood following burn injury by increasing vascular resistance. The 
      purpose of this study was to investigate whether wound healing and perioperative 
      hemodynamics are affected by propranolol administration in severely burned 
      adults. METHODS: Sixty-nine adult patients with burns covering ≥ 30% of the total 
      body surface area (TBSA) were enrolled in this IRB-approved study. Patients 
      received standard burn care with (n = 35) or without (control, n = 34) 
      propranolol. Propranolol was administered within 48 hours of burns and given 
      throughout hospital discharge to decrease heart rate by approximately 20% from 
      admission levels. Wound healing was determined by comparing the time between 
      grafting procedures. Blood loss was determined by comparing pre- and 
      postoperative hematocrit while factoring in operative graft area. Data were 
      collected between first admission and first discharge. RESULTS: Demographics, 
      burn size, and mortality were comparable in the control and propranolol groups. 
      Patients in the propranolol group received an average propranolol dose of 3.3 ± 
      3.0 mg/kg/day. Daily average heart rate over the first 30 days was significantly 
      lower in the propranolol group (P < 0.05). The average number of days between 
      skin grafting procedures was also lower in propranolol patients (10 ± 5 days) 
      than in control patients (17 ± 12 days; P = 0.02), indicative of a faster donor 
      site healing time in the propranolol group. Packed red blood cell infusion was 
      similar between groups (control 5.3 ± 5.4 units vs. propranolol 4.4 ± 3.1 units, 
      P = 0.89). Propranolol was associated with a 5 to 7% improvement in perioperative 
      hematocrit during grafting procedures of 4,000 to 16,000 cm(2) compared to 
      control (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of propranolol during the acute 
      hospitalization period diminishes blood loss during skin grafting procedures and 
      markedly improves wound healing in severely burned adults. As burn patients 
      require serial surgical interventions for motor and cosmetic repair, restricting 
      blood loss during operative intervention is optimal.

      Agents Result in Long-Term Kidney Transplant Survival Without Immunosuppression: 
      II, Study in Miniature Swine.
PG  - 2066-76
LID - 10.1111/ajt.13703 [doi]
AB  - Transplantation is now lifesaving therapy for patients with end-stage organ 
      failure but requires lifelong immunosuppression with resultant morbidity. Current 
      immunosuppressive strategies inhibit T cell activation and prevent 
      donor-recipient engagement. Therefore, it is not surprising that few host cells 
      are demonstrated in donor grafts. However, our recent small animal studies found 
      large numbers of recipient stem cells present after transplantation and 
      pharmacological mobilization, resulting in a chimeric, repopulated organ. We now 
      confirm these findings in a well-characterized large animal preclinical model. 
      Here, we show that AMD3100 and FK506 mobilization of endogenous stem cells 
      immediately post kidney transplantation combined with repeat therapy at 1, 2, and 
      3 months led to drug-free long-term survival in maximally immunologically 
      mismatched swine. Three long-term recipients have stable chimeric transplants, 
      preserved antidonor skin graft responses, and normal serum creatinine levels 
      despite withdrawal of all medication for 3 years.

TI  - Tilapia fish skin as a new biologic graft for neovaginoplasty in 
      Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome: a video case report.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a McIndoe procedure technique for surgical management of 
      Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome with the use of Nile tilapia skin as a 
      scaffold for the proliferation of new vaginal epithelium. DESIGN: Surgical video 
      article. Local Institutional Review Board approval and written permission from 
      the patient were obtained. There were no conflicts of interest. SETTING: 
      University hospital. PATIENT(S): A 17-year-old woman who presented at our 
      gynecology department with the complaint of primary amenorrhea. At physical 
      examination, she had a phenotypically normal vulva with no vaginal canal. 
      Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal ovaries and 
      absence of uterus and vaginal canal. No other congenital malformations were 
      found. Karyotype was 46,XX. INTERVENTION(S): The McIndoe procedure involved only 
      a vaginal approach. Labia minora were separated, and a transverse midline 
      incision of 3 cm was made. The vesicorectal space was progressively dissected. 
      Blunt dissection was performed initially with digital separation of tissues. The 
      neovagina was then inspected with the introduction of a vaginal speculum, 
      allowing for review of hemostasis. Blunt dissection was continued with the aid of 
      the speculum, to reach the appropriate vaginal dimensions. Subsequently, a 
      vaginal acrylic mold covered with two pieces of processed and sterilized tilapia 
      fish skin was inserted and accommodated into the newly created cavity. The 
      external side of the tilapia skin, which maintained its grayish coloration after 
      the removal of the scales, stayed in contact with the acrylic mold, while the 
      white internal side of the tilapia skin, which was previously attached to the 
      fish's muscle, stayed in contact with the walls of the neocavity. The mold was 
      held in position by four multifilament polyglactin 1.0 sutures in the labia 
      majora, thus preventing expulsion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Anatomic data, such 
      as measurement of the final canal length, and histomorphologic analysis, 180 days 
      after surgery. RESULT(S): The patient remained on bed rest for 9 days, after 
      which the tilapia fish skin had been partially reabsorbed. After this time, the 
      acrylic mold was removed. A larger plastic mold was then inserted and the patient 
      was advised to wear it day and night for the first postoperative month. The 
      vaginal mold had to be worn each night until normal sexual intercourse was 
      possible. The final canal length 180 days after surgery was between 8 and 9 cm. 
      For the histopathologic analysis, fragments of the lateral vaginal wall were 
      removed 180 days after surgery and showed the presence of stratified squamous 
      epithelium with five cell layers, ectasic blood vessels, and occasional 
      desquamated epithelial cells. CONCLUSION(S): The procedure described offered this 
      patient an anatomic and functional neovagina by means of a simple, safe, easy, 
      effective, quick, and minimally invasive procedure. Limitations include the 
      experimental nature of this study, based on a single case report with no 
      long-term outcome results. The tilapia fish skin is a low-cost and widely 
      available biomaterial.

TI  - Improvement of tissue survival of skin flaps by 5α-reductase inhibitors: possible 
      involvement of nitric oxide and inducible nitric oxide synthase.
PG  - 111-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin flap grafting is a popular approach for reconstruction of 
      critical skin and underlying soft tissue injuries. In a previous study, we 
      demonstrated the beneficial effects of two 5α-reductase inhibitors, azelaic acid 
      and finasteride, on tissue survival in a rat model of skin flap grafting. In the 
      current study, we investigated the involvement of nitric oxide and inducible 
      nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in graft survival mediated by these agents. METHODS: 
      A number of 42 male rats were randomly allocated into six groups: 1, normal 
      saline topical application; 2, azelaic acid (100 mg/flap); 3, finasteride (1 
      mg/flap); 4, injection of L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (i.p., 20 
      mg/kg); 5, L-NAME (20 mg/kg, i.p.) + azelaic acid (100 mg/flap, topical); 6, 
      L-NAME (20 mg/kg, i.p.) + finasteride (1 mg/flap, topical). Tissue survival, 
      level of nitric oxide, and iNOS expression in groups were measured. RESULTS: Our 
      data revealed that azelaic acid and finasteride significantly increased the 
      expression of iNOS protein and nitric oxide (NO) levels in graft tissue (P < 
      0.05). These increases in iNOS expression and NO level were associated with 
      higher survival of the graft tissue. CONCLUSION: It appears that alterations of 
      the NO metabolism are implicated in the azelaic acid- and finasteride-mediated 
      survival of the skin flaps.

TI  - Adipose Tissue-Derived Microvascular Fragments Improve Vascularization, 
      Lymphangiogenesis, and Integration of Dermal Skin Substitutes.

LID - S0022-202X(16)32275-8 [pii]

AB  - Full-thickness skin defects can be covered with dermal skin substitutes in 
      combination with split-thickness skin grafts. However, slow vascularization of 
      the matrices bears the risk of wound infection and extends the length of 
      hospitalization. To overcome these problems, we describe a promising 
      vascularization strategy. Green fluorescent protein(+) adipose tissue-derived 
      microvascular fragments (ad-MVF) were isolated from epididymal fat pads of 
      C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)1Osb/J mice. ad-MVF were seeded on collagen-glycosaminoglycan 
      matrices, which were implanted into full-thickness skin defects in the dorsal 
      skinfold chamber of wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Nonseeded matrices served as 
      controls. Vascularization, lymphangiogenesis, and integration of the implants 
      were studied by using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology, and 
      immunohistochemistry over 14 days. ad-MVF rapidly reassembled into microvascular 
      networks within the implants, which developed interconnections to the host 
      microvasculature. Accordingly, vascularization of the implants was markedly 
      accelerated, as indicated by a significantly higher microvessel density when 
      compared with controls. Moreover, dense lymphatic networks originating from the 
      green fluorescent protein(+) ad-MVF developed within the implants. This was 
      associated with an improved implant integration. Hence, seeding ad-MVF on 
      collagen-glycosaminoglycan matrices represents a potential strategy to reduce 
      morbidity and hospitalization of patients undergoing the treatment of 
      full-thickness skin defects.

TI  - Depletion of foxp3(+) T cells abrogates tolerance of skin and heart allografts in 
      murine mixed chimeras without the loss of mixed chimerism.
PG  - 2263-2274
LID - 10.1111/ajt.12851 [doi]
AB  - The relative contribution of central and peripheral mechanisms to the generation 
      and maintenance of allograft tolerance is of considerable interest. Here, we 
      present new evidence that regulatory T cells (Foxp3(+) ) maintain skin and heart 
      allograft tolerance in mixed hematopoietic chimeric mice. Transient depletion of 
      both donor- and recipient-derived Foxp3(+) cells was necessary and sufficient to 
      induce decisive rejection of long-accepted skin and heart allografts. In 
      contrast, stable hematopoietic chimerism remained, and there was no detectable 
      induction of donor-specific reactivity to hematopoietic cells. Foxp3(+) cell 
      depletion did not result in the rejection of skin grafts of only MHC-disparate 
      donors (B6.C-H2(d) /bByJ), indicating that MHC antigens were not the target in 
      the graft. We conclude that two different mechanisms of tolerance are present in 
      mixed chimeras. Hematopoietic chimerism, resistant to Foxp3(+) depletion, is 
      probably due to deletional tolerance to MHC antigens, as supported by previous 
      studies. In contrast, regulatory tolerance mechanisms involving Foxp3(+) cells 
      are required to control reactivity against non-MHC antigens not present on 
      hematopoietic lineages.

TI  - Erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp following surgical procedures: a 
      systematic review.
LID - 13030/qt9d80k39g [pii]
AB  - Erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp (EPDS) occurs in elderly individuals 
      with significant actinic damage. EPDS also occurs in association with surgery; 
      however, significant studies determining an association of EPDS with type of 
      surgical closure is absent. This review examines whether the closure method 
      following cutaneous surgery performed on the scalp is associated with development 
      of EPDS. Databases were reviewed and studies describing EPDS after cutaneous 
      surgery met inclusion criteria. Articles were excluded if EPDS developed after 
      trauma or non-surgical procedures. Descriptive analyses were performed on the 
      data. Thirteen case reports and 6 case series involving 32 patients met inclusion 
      criteria. Fourteen articles (73.7%) stated that EPDS developed in the same 
      location as, or near to, the closure site. Thirteen patients (40.6%) developed 
      EPDS following skin grafting. Three patients (9.4%) developed EPDS following 
      secondary intention healing, two patients (6.3%) following repair by primary 
      intention, and one patient (3.1%) following repair with a local skin flap. 
      Thirteen cases (40.6%) did not specify closure type. This review revealed that 
      surgical procedures performed on the scalp utilizing skin grafts for closure may 
      be increasingly associated with the development of EPDS compared to other closure 
      types.

TI  - IL-7 receptor blockade following T cell depletion promotes long-term allograft 
      survival.
PG  - 1723-33
LID - 66287 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI66287 [doi]
AB  - T cell depletion is commonly used in organ transplantation for immunosuppression; 
      however, a restoration of T cell homeostasis following depletion leads to 
      increased memory T cells, which may promote transplant rejection. The cytokine 
      IL-7 is important for controlling lymphopoiesis under both normal and lymphopenic 
      conditions. Here, we investigated whether blocking IL-7 signaling with a mAb that 
      targets IL-7 receptor α (IL-7Rα) alone or following T cell depletion confers an 
      advantage for allograft survival in murine transplant models. We found that IL-7R 
      blockade alone induced indefinite pancreatic islet allograft survival if 
      anti-IL-7R treatment was started 3 weeks before graft. IL-7R blockade following 
      anti-CD4- and anti-CD8-mediated T cell depletion markedly prolonged skin 
      allograft survival. Furthermore, IL-7 inhibition in combination with T cell 
      depletion synergized with either CTLA-4Ig administration or suboptimal doses of 
      tacrolimus to induce long-term skin graft acceptance in this stringent transplant 
      model. Together, these therapies inhibited T cell reconstitution, decreased 
      memory T cell numbers, increased the relative frequency of Tregs, and abrogated 
      both cellular and humoral alloimmune responses. Our data suggest that IL-7R 
      blockade following T cell depletion has potential as a robust, immunosuppressive 
      therapy in transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study is to investigate the therapeutic 
      effect of fasciotomy through multiple small skin incisions for the treatment of 
      early osteofascial compartment syndrome in children. METHODS: From January 2009 
      to May 2017, 56 pediatric patients with early osteofascial compartment syndrome 
      in their limbs were admitted into our department and treated with multiple small 
      skin incisions for decompression at the early stage. The skin incisions, 
      function, and sensation of the limbs were followed up. RESULTS: The osteofascial 
      compartment syndrome was diagnosed at 7.4 ± 2.1 h after injury, and then 
      fasciotomy was performed at 1.4 ± 0.4 h later. The average procedure time of 
      fasciotomy was 12.7 ± 4.8 min. No postoperative incision infections or 
      neurovascular injuries were observed in all the patients. The incisions 
      completely healed in 7-10 days with an average healing time of 8 days without 
      secondary suture. The patients were followed up for an average of 5.1 years. No 
      Volkmann's contractures in the injured limbs were found. The appearance, 
      electromyography, and nerve conduction velocity of the affected limbs were not 
      significantly different from that of the contralateral limbs. All the patients 
      were free of symptoms and were fully recovered of sensation and function, being 
      an "excellent" outcome at the latest follow-up. CONCLUSION: Fasciotomy through 
      multiple small skin incisions, which can be useful to decompress the compartment 
      pressure with fewer complications, is a simple and effective strategy for the 
      treatment of early osteofascial compartment syndrome in children.

AB  - Hypertrophic scar (HSc) contraction following burn injury causes contractures. 
      Contractures are painful and disfiguring. Current therapies are marginally 
      effective. To study pathogenesis and develop new therapies, a murine model is 
      needed. We have created a validated immune-competent murine HSc model. A 
      third-degree burn was created on dorsum of C57BL/6 mice. Three days postburn, 
      tissue was excised and grafted with ear skin. Graft contraction was analyzed and 
      tissue harvested on different time points. Outcomes were compared with human 
      condition to validate the model. To confirm graft survival, green fluorescent 
      protein (GFP) mice were used, and histologic analysis was performed to 
      differentiate between ear and back skin. Role of panniculus carnosus in 
      contraction was analyzed. Cellularity was assessed with 
      4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Collagen maturation was assessed with Picro-sirius 
      red. Mast cells were stained with Toluidine blue. Macrophages were detected with 
      F4/80 immune. Vascularity was assessed with CD31 immune. RNA for contractile 
      proteins was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      (qRT-PCR). Elastic moduli of skin and scar tissue were analyzed using a 
      microstrain analyzer. Grafts contracted to ∼45% of their original size by day 14 
      and maintained their size. Grafting of GFP mouse skin onto wild-type mice, and 
      analysis of dermal thickness and hair follicle density, confirmed graft survival. 
      Interestingly, hair follicles disappeared after grafting and regenerated in ear 
      skin configuration by day 30. Radiological analysis revealed that panniculus 
      carnosus doesn't contribute to contraction. Microscopic analyses showed that 
      grafts show increase in cellularity. Granulation tissue formed after day 3. 
      Collagen analysis revealed increases in collagen maturation over time. CD31 stain 
      revealed increased vascularity. Macrophages and mast cells were increased. 
      qRT-PCR showed up-regulation of transforming growth factor beta, alpha smooth 
      muscle actin, and rho-associated protein kinase 2 in HSc. Tensile testing 
      revealed that human skin and scar tissues are tougher than mouse skin and scar 
      tissues.

      Histocompatibility Antigen-Mismatched Grafts.
PG  - 46-50
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1500669 [doi]
AB  - In transplantation, a major obstacle for graft acceptance in MHC-matched 
      individuals is the mismatch of minor histocompatibility Ags. Minor 
      histocompatibility Ags are peptides derived from polymorphic proteins that can be 
      presented by APCs on MHC molecules. The APC subtype uniquely responsible for the 
      rejection of minor Ag-mismatched grafts has not yet been identified. In this 
      study, we examined graft rejection in three mouse models: 1) mismatch of 
      male-specific minor Ags, 2) mismatch of minor Ags distinct from male-specific 
      minor Ags, and 3) skin transplant. This study demonstrates that in the absence of 
      pathogen-associated molecular patterns, Batf3-dependent dendritic cells elicit 
      the rejection of cells and grafts expressing mismatched minor Ags. The 
      implication of our findings in clinical transplantation may be significant, as 
      minor Ag reactivity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple allograft 
      tissues.

TI  - Low-Affinity Memory CD8+ T Cells Mediate Robust Heterologous Immunity.
PG  - 2838-46
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1500639 [doi]
AB  - Heterologous immunity is recognized as a significant barrier to transplant 
      tolerance. Whereas it has been established that pathogen-elicited memory T cells 
      can have high or low affinity for cross-reactive allogeneic peptide-MHC, the role 
      of TCR affinity during heterologous immunity has not been explored. We 
      established a model with which to investigate the impact of TCR-priming affinity 
      on memory T cell populations following a graft rechallenge. In contrast to 
      high-affinity priming, low-affinity priming elicited fully differentiated memory 
      T cells with a CD45RB(hi) status. High CD45RB status enabled robust secondary 
      responses in vivo, as demonstrated by faster graft rejection kinetics and greater 
      proliferative responses. CD45RB blockade prolonged graft survival in low 
      affinity-primed mice, but not in high affinity-primed mice. Mechanistically, low 
      affinity-primed memory CD8(+) T cells produced more IL-2 and significantly 
      upregulated IL-2Rα expression during rechallenge. We found that CD45RB(hi) status 
      was also a stable marker of priming affinity within polyclonal CD8(+) T cell 
      populations. Following high-affinity rechallenge, low affinity-primed CD45RB(hi) 
      cells became CD45RB(lo), demonstrating that CD45RB status acts as an 
      affinity-based differentiation switch on CD8(+) T cells. Thus, these data 
      establish a novel mechanism by which CD45 isoforms tune low affinity-primed 
      memory CD8(+) T cells to become potent secondary effectors following heterologous 
      rechallenge. These findings have direct implications for allogeneic heterologous 
      immunity by demonstrating that despite a lower precursor frequency, low-affinity 
      priming is sufficient to generate memory cells that mediate potent secondary 
      responses against a cross-reactive graft challenge.

TI  - Transitional-2 B cells acquire regulatory function during tolerance induction and 
      contribute to allograft survival.
PG  - 843-53
LID - 10.1002/eji.201445082 [doi]
AB  - In humans, tolerance to renal transplants has been associated with alterations in 
      B-cell gene transcription and maintenance of the numbers of circulating 
      transitional B cells. Here, we use a mouse model of transplantation tolerance to 
      investigate the contribution of B cells to allograft survival. We demonstrate 
      that transfer of B cells from mice rendered tolerant to MHC class I mismatched 
      skin grafts can prolong graft survival in a dose-dependent and antigen-specific 
      manner to a degree similar to that afforded by graft-specific regulatory T (Treg) 
      cells. Tolerance in this model was associated with an increase in transitional-2 
      (T2) B cells. Only T2 B cells from tolerized mice, not naïve T2 nor alloantigen 
      experienced T2, were capable of prolonging skin allograft survival, and 
      suppressing T-cell activation. Tolerized T2 B cells expressed lower levels of 
      CD86, increased TIM-1, and demonstrated a preferential survival in vivo. 
      Furthermore, we demonstrate a synergistic effect between tolerized B cells and 
      graft-specific Treg cells. IL-10 production by T2 B cells did not contribute to 
      tolerance, as shown by transfer of B cells from IL-10(-/-) mice. These results 
      suggest that T2 B cells in tolerant patients may include a population of 
      regulatory B cells that directly inhibit graft rejection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a "vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) 
      - artificial dermis implantation (ADI) - thin partial thickness skin grafting 
      (TSG)" sequential therapy for deep and infected wounds in children. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Fifty-three pediatric patients with deep and infected wounds were 
      treated with sequential VSD-ADI-TSG therapy. The efficacy of this treatment was 
      compared with that of the surgical debridement-change dressings-thin partial 
      thickness skin grafting previously performed on 20 patients. Survival of tissue 
      grafts, color and flexibility, subcutaneous fullness and scar formation of the 
      graft site were examined and compared. RESULTS: The sequential therapy combined 
      the advantages of the VSD treatment, in reducing tissue necrosis and infection on 
      the wound surfaces and promoting the growth of granulation tissue, with the 
      enhancement of grafting by artificial dermis. Compared with the 20 controls, skin 
      grafted on the artificial dermis was more smooth and glossy, while the textures 
      of the region were more elastic, and the scars were significantly lighter in 
      Vancouver scale. CONCLUSION: The sequential VSD-ADI-TSG therapy is a simple and 
      effective treatment for children with deep and infected wounds. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: IV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydrogen gas exists in the atmosphere and was previously considered 
      an inert gas. It has been reported to have protective effects on tissue 
      ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injuries in animal models. The protective mechanism of 
      hydrogen molecules is based on selectively reducing highly strong oxidants in 
      cells, thereby reducing inflammation and decreasing the contents of MDA, FOXO3a, 
      and other pathways that result in flap necrosis. Previous studies were conducted 
      with postconditioning with hydrogen. In this article, we want to investigate 
      whether inhalation of hydrogen has a preventive effect on IR injury. METHODS: 
      Forty-five adult male Sprague Dawley rats (body weight 220-250 g) were randomly 
      divided into three groups: (1) Sham operation group (SH), (2) 
      Ischemia-reperfusion injury group (IR), and (3) Ischemia-reperfusion injury with 
      preconditioning hydrogen group (PRH). IR injury was induced by clamping the right 
      superficial epigastric artery for 3 h. Before undergoing 3 h of IR management, 
      the PRH group was treated with hydrogen inhalation for 1 h. On the third 
      postoperative day, survival area and blood perfusion of the flap were assessed 
      using laser Doppler flowmetry. RIP1 and RIP3 were examined by immunological 
      detection and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Both the IR and PRH groups had less 
      skin flap survival area and less blood perfusion than the sham group (P < 0.05). 
      RIP1 and RIP3 were highly expressed in the IR and PRH groups when compared with 
      those in the SH group (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in flap 
      survival rate (32.34 ± 2.19% and 33.09 ± 1.64%), average blood perfusion 
      (41.66 ± 3.53 pu, 48.57 ± 2.83 pu), and expression of RIP1 and RIP3 
      (0.5167 ± 0.1409 and 0.4693 ± 0.1454) between the IR and PRH groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Preconditioning with one-time inhaled hydrogen does not attenuate skin flap IR 
      injuries in rat models.

AB  - The automated blister epidermal micrograft (ABEM) is a newly introduced surgical 
      transplantation for refractory vitiligo. Comparative analysis of other surgical 
      methods is lacking. We conducted a retrospective study to compare the efficacy, 
      safety, and experience of ABEM with conventional suction blister epidermal graft 
      (SBEG). A total of 118 anatomically based vitiligo lesions from 75 patients were 
      included. The primary outcome was the degree of repigmentation; the patient and 
      operator experience were evaluated. SBEG had a significantly greater incidence of 
      repigmentation (p < 0.001), as measured by the Physician Global Assessment, as 
      well as improvements in the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index, particularly on the 
      face/neck area (p < 0.001). ABEM, on the contrary, had reduced donor harvest 
      time, a better patient operative experience, and more significant Dermatology 
      Life Quality Index improvements. In a subgroup of 38 lesions from ten patients 
      who received both SBEG and ABEM concomitantly, there was no difference in the 
      degree of repigmentation in the same recipient area. Overall, the degree of 
      repigmentation for SBEG is higher than ABEM, especially in the mobilized region, 
      and the cost is less expensive. On the contrary, ABEM requires less procedure 
      learning curve and can supply a greater transplanting zone with shorter donor 
      site recovery. Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of two blister grafting 
      procedures is essential for optimal surgical outcomes for vitiligo grafting.

TI  - Application of Minicircle Technology of Self-Reproducing Synthetic Protein Drugs 
      in Preventing Skin Allograft Rejection.
PG  - 430-40
LID - 10.12659/AOT.893828 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, it has been reported that minicircle vectors could allow 
      the expression of transgenes using the protein synthesis system of the host. 
      Here, we tested a novel strategy to permit the production of synthetic biologics 
      using minicircle technology and evaluated their feasibility as a therapeutic tool 
      in a skin allograft model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We engineered vectors to carry 
      cassette sequences for tocilizumab [anti-soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) 
      antibody] and/or etanercept [tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2)-Fc fusion 
      protein], and then isolated minicircle vectors from the parent vectors. We 
      verified the production of proteins from minicircles and their duration in 
      HEK293T cells and mice. We also evaluated whether these proteins were expressed 
      at levels sufficient to ameliorate skin allograft rejection in mice. RESULTS: 
      Each minicircle transfected into cells was detectable for at least 30 days. In 
      mice, the drugs were mainly expressed in the liver and were detectable for at 
      least 10 days after a single injection. These drugs were also detected in the 
      blood. Treatment of mice with minicircles prolonged skin allograft survival, 
      which was accompanied by a reduction of the number of interferon-γ+ or 
      interleukin-17+ lymphocytes and an induction of forkhead box P3 expression. These 
      findings suggest that blocking of sIL-6R and/or TNF-α using minicircles encoding 
      tocilizumab and/or etanercept was functionally active and relevant for preventing 
      acute allograft rejection. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reproducing synthetic protein drugs 
      produced using minicircle technology are potentially powerful tools for 
      preventing acute rejection in transplantation.

TI  - Long-term Tolerance Toward Haploidentical Vascularized Composite Allograft 
      Transplantation in a Canine Model Using Bone Marrow or Mobilized Stem Cells.
PG  - e120-e127
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of safe and reliable protocols for the 
      transplantation of the face and hands may be accomplished with animal modeling of 
      transplantation of vascularized composite allografts (VCA). Previously, we 
      demonstrated that tolerance to a VCA could be achieved after canine recipients 
      were simultaneously given marrow from a dog leukocyte antigen-identical donor. In 
      the present study, we extend those findings across a dog leukocyte antigen 
      mismatched barrier. METHODS: Eight recipient dogs received total body irradiation 
      (4.5 cGy), hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), either marrow (n = 4) or 
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (n = 
      4), and a VCA transplant from the HCT donor. Post grafting immunosuppression 
      consisted of mycophenolate mofetil (28 days) and cyclosporine (35 days). RESULTS: 
      In 4 dogs receiving bone marrow, 1 accepted both its marrow transplant and 
      demonstrated long-term tolerance to the donor VCA (>52 weeks). Three dogs 
      rejected both their marrow transplants and VCA at 5 to 7 weeks posttransplant. 
      Dogs receiving mobilized stem cells all accepted their stem cell transplant and 
      became tolerant to the VCA. However, 3 dogs developed graft-versus-host disease, 
      whereas 1 dog rejected its stem cell graft by week 15 but exhibited long-term 
      tolerance toward its VCA (>90 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that 
      simultaneous transplantation of mobilized stem cells and a VCA is feasible and 
      leads to tolerance toward the VCA in a haploidentical setting. However, there is 
      a higher rate of donor stem cell engraftment compared with marrow HCT and an 
      increase in the incidence of graft-versus-host disease.

AB  - Mixed chimerism, a phenomenon involved in the development of specific alloantigen 
      tolerance, could be achieved through the transplantation of hematopoietic stem 
      cells into properly prepared recipients. Because the C3a complement component 
      modulates hematopoietic cell trafficking after transplantation, in the present 
      study, we investigated the influence of the C3a deficiency on mixed chimerism and 
      alloantigen tolerance induction. To induce mixed chimerism, C57BL/6J (wild-type 
      strain; H-2K(b); I-E(-)) and B6.129S4-C3(tm1Crr)/J (C3a-deficient) mice were 
      exposed to 3 G total body irradiation (day -1). Subsequently, these mice were 
      treated with CD8-blocking (day -2) and CD40L-blocking (days 0 and 4) antibodies, 
      followed by transplantation with 20 × 10(6) Balb/c (H-2K(d); I-E(+)) bone marrow 
      cells (day 0). The degree of mixed chimerism in peripheral blood leukocytes was 
      measured several times during the 20-week experiment. The tolerance to Balb/c 
      mouse antigens was assessed based on the number of lymphocytes expressing Vβ5 and 
      Vβ11 T-cell receptor and on skin-graft (day 0) acceptance. Applying our 
      experimental model, mixed chimerism and alloantigen tolerance were effectively 
      induced in C57BL/6J (wild-type) mice, but not in C3a(-/-) animals. The present 
      study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that C3a is vital for 
      achieving stable mixed chimerism and related to this induction of transplant 
      tolerance.

TI  - Disruption of Coronin 1 Signaling in T Cells Promotes Allograft Tolerance while 
      Maintaining Anti-Pathogen Immunity.

AB  - The ability of the immune system to discriminate self from non-self is essential 
      for eradicating microbial pathogens but is also responsible for allograft 
      rejection. Whether it is possible to selectively suppress alloresponses while 
      maintaining anti-pathogen immunity remains unknown. We found that mice deficient 
      in coronin 1, a regulator of naive T cell homeostasis, fully retained allografts 
      while maintaining T cell-specific responses against microbial pathogens. 
      Mechanistically, coronin 1-deficiency increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
      (cAMP) concentrations to suppress allo-specific T cell responses. Costimulation 
      induced on microbe-infected antigen presenting cells was able to overcome 
      cAMP-mediated immunosuppression to maintain anti-pathogen immunity. In vivo 
      pharmacological modulation of this pathway or a prior transfer of coronin 
      1-deficient T cells actively suppressed allograft rejection. These results define 
      a coronin 1-dependent regulatory axis in T cells important for allograft 
      rejection and suggest that modulation of this pathway may be a promising approach 
      to achieve long-term acceptance of mismatched allografts.

TI  - An Automated and Minimally Invasive Tool for Generating Autologous Viable 
      Epidermal Micrografts.
PG  - 57-64
LID - 10.1097/01.ASW.0000476072.88818.aa [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A new epidermal harvesting tool (CelluTome; Kinetic Concepts, Inc, San 
      Antonio, Texas) created epidermal micrografts with minimal donor site damage, 
      increased expansion ratios, and did not require the use of an operating room. The 
      tool, which applies both heat and suction concurrently to normal skin, was used 
      to produce epidermal micrografts that were assessed for uniform viability, 
      donor-site healing, and discomfort during and after the epidermal harvesting 
      procedure. DESIGN: This study was a prospective, noncomparative institutional 
      review board-approved healthy human study to assess epidermal graft viability, 
      donor-site morbidity, and patient experience. SETTING: These studies were 
      conducted at the multispecialty research facility, Clinical Trials of Texas, Inc, 
      San Antonio. PATIENTS: The participants were 15 healthy human volunteers. 
      RESULTS: The average viability of epidermal micrografts was 99.5%. Skin 
      assessment determined that 76% to 100% of the area of all donor sites was the 
      same in appearance as the surrounding skin within 14 days after epidermal 
      harvest. A mean pain of 1.3 (on a scale of 1 to 5) was reported throughout the 
      harvesting process. CONCLUSIONS: Use of this automated, minimally invasive 
      harvesting system provided a simple, low-cost method of producing uniformly 
      viable autologous epidermal micrografts with minimal patient discomfort and 
      superficial donor-site wound healing within 2 weeks.

TI  - Development of antidonor antibody directed toward non-major histocompatibility 
      complex antigens in tolerant animals.
PG  - 514-9
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000000249 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of antibodies directed against antigens 
      other than major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens is poorly understood, 
      and there are few large animal models in which such antibodies can be examined. 
      We studied, both retrospectively and prospectively, the development of antibodies 
      to non-MHC antigens in tolerant miniature swine. METHODS: Our database was 
      assessed for cases of antidonor antibody formation in tolerant animals over the 
      last 20 years. Flow cytometry, absorption assays, and familial analyses for 
      inheritance pattern of the gene(s) potentially responsible for the antibody 
      reactivities were carried out, and an animal determined to be negative for this 
      reactivity was immunized by a skin graft and subcutaneous injections of 
      peripheral blood monocyte cells from an antigen-positive donor. RESULTS: Sixteen 
      of 469 tolerant animals tested were found to have developed antidonor antibodies. 
      These antibodies were found to be specific for the same, presumably single, 
      non-MHC antigen. Familial analyses indicated that the gene encoding this antigen 
      was expressed in an autosomal-dominant manner in approximately 95% of the herd. 
      In a prospective study, antidonor antibodies with the same specificity as those 
      observed retrospectively were successfully induced in an antigen-negative animal 
      after immunization with peripheral blood monocyte cells. CONCLUSION: To our 
      knowledge, this is the first report of the development of antibodies to a highly 
      prevalent, non-MHC antigen present on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 
      developing in tolerant animals without signs of graft dysfunction. Considering 
      the concern often raised by the appearance of antidonor antibodies in transplant 
      recipients, these data could have important implications for clinical 
      transplantation.

TI  - Cortical perforation combined with Masquelet technique to treat extensive bone 
      and soft tissue injury: A case report.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We report a case of a serious traffic accident injury to the lower 
      leg involving a large skin defect with the long bone exposed. In this situation, 
      the usual intervention is flap transplantation after debridement and infection 
      control by completely covering the wound. Flap transplantation has certain 
      limitations; therefore, we chose the surgical strategy of cortical bone 
      drilling-induced membrane technology (Masquelet technique). CASE PRESENTATION: A 
      28-year-old healthy man was injured in a car accident and presented to the local 
      hospital with a large skin defect and exposed left lower leg long bone. After 
      transfer to our hospital, the patient underwent repeated debridement and skin 
      graft, a cortex borehole combined with bone cement cover, and ankle fusion. The 
      patient achieved full recovery. CONCLUSION: From our experience in treating this 
      case, we conclude that large skin defects, periosteal stripping, and bone 
      exposure due to physical injury can be successfully treated with cortical 
      perforation and the Masquelet technique so as to avoid flap transplantation. 
      Therefore, this method can be used for large segment bone exposure.

TI  - Sinking skin flap syndrome in glioblastoma.
LID - 10.1136/bcr-2014-207158 [doi]
LID - bcr2014207158
AB  - Sinking skin flap syndrome (SSFS) is a rare neurological complication in patients 
      with traumatic haemorrhage, stroke or cerebral oedema who undergo decompressive 
      craniectomy to relieve increased intracranial pressure. Hallmark of SSFS is the 
      sinking of the scalp to a plane lower than the edges of the skull defect in the 
      setting of neurological deterioration. Our objective is to report that SSFS can 
      present after small craniotomy without cerebral cortex compression and to share 
      our diagnostic/therapeutic approach. A 62-year-old woman with a glioblastoma 
      developed SSFS after a small craniectomy and tumour resection without cerebral 
      cortex compression but a decrease in the surgical cavity volume. Brain MRI showed 
      decreased size of the surgical cavity. Interestingly, the patient also developed 
      posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). This case highlights an 
      atypical presentation of SSFS and the possible association with PRES. It also 
      illustrates how an early cranioplasty can successfully reverse SSFS.

TI  - Prolonged Survival of Pig Skin on Baboons After Administration of Pig Cells 
      Expressing Human CD47.
PG  - 316-321
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000001267 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Successful xenotransplantation will likely depend, in part, on the 
      induction of immunological tolerance, because the high levels of 
      immunosuppression otherwise required would likely have unacceptable side effects. 
      Rapid clearance of administered porcine hematopoietic stem cells by primate 
      macrophages has hampered previous attempts to induce tolerance through mixed 
      hematopoietic chimerism across a pig-to-primate barrier. Phagocytosis is normally 
      inhibited by binding of cell surface protein CD47 to macrophage signal regulatory 
      protein α receptors. However, pig CD47 has previously been shown to be 
      ineffective in transducing signals through primate signal regulatory protein α. 
      METHODS: Mobilized peripheral blood hematopoietic cells from transgenic swine 
      expressing high or low levels of human CD47 were infused into conditioned baboons 
      at 3 time points over a 9-week period. Xenogeneic peripheral blood chimerism was 
      assessed after each infusion. Split thickness skin grafts from the hematopoietic 
      cell donor swine were placed on recipients 5 weeks after the last cell infusion 
      and 7 weeks after the discontinuation of all immunosuppression to test immune 
      response. RESULTS: The level and duration of transient chimerism were 
      substantially greater in baboons receiving hematopoietic cells from a pig 
      expressing high levels of human CD47. Skin graft survival on high CD47 recipients 
      was prolonged as well, in 1 case showing no signs of rejection at least 53 days 
      after placement. CONCLUSIONS: Prolongation of transient porcine chimerism via 
      transgenic expression of human CD47 in a primate model is associated with an 
      immune modulating effect, leading to markedly prolonged survival of donor swine 
      skin xenografts that may be applicable to clinical solid organ 
      xenotransplantation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective study was performed to investigate the distribution 
      of proximal ulnar artery perforating vessels through three-dimensional blood 
      vessel reconstruction and examine the presence and consistency of the perforating 
      vessels intraoperatively. METHODS: For anatomical guidance, three-dimensional 
      blood vessel reconstruction was performed to determine the consistent presence of 
      perforating vessels in the proximal ulnar artery. A free proximal ulnar artery 
      perforator flap was then transferred in 17 patients to resurface skin defects on 
      the hands. Color Doppler ultrasound was used to identify and mark the perforating 
      vessels. Intraoperative evaluation was conducted to check for anastomosis of the 
      perforating vessels at the marked sites and assess the vessel anastomosis 
      conditions. RESULTS: No vascular crisis, flap necrosis, or wound infection 
      occurred after surgery in 15 patients. Postoperative follow-up was conducted for 
      6 to 36 months. The appearance of the flap was satisfactory, the texture of the 
      flap was soft, sensation was well restored, and hand function was not limited. 
      The mean two-point discrimination of the flap was 7.6 ± 2.2 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Free 
      sensory proximal ulnar artery perforator flap transfer is a safe and reliable 
      surgical technique with respect to restoration of both the appearance and sensory 
      function of the hand.

TI  - Adipose- and Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Prolong Graft Survival in 
      Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation.
PG  - 1765-73

AB  - BACKGROUND: Strategies aiming at minimization or elimination of systemic 
      immunosuppression are key immediate goals for clinical expansion of vascularized 
      composite allotransplantation (VCA). We compared the in vitro and in vivo 
      immunomodulatory efficacy of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) and 
      bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs in a rat VCA model. METHODS: Both cell types were 
      tested in vitro for suppressor function using mixed lymphocyte reactivity assays. 
      AD-MSCs or BM-MSCs were administered intravenously (1 × 10 or 5 × 10 
      cells/animal) to Lewis rat recipients of mismatched Brown Norway hindlimb 
      transplants. Short course tacrolimus (FK-506) monotherapy was withdrawn at 
      postoperative day 21. In vivo regulatory T-cell induction, peripheral blood 
      chimerism, and microchimerism in lymphatic organs were analyzed. RESULTS: AD-MSCs 
      and BM-MSCs exhibited strong dose-dependent suppressor function in vitro, which 
      was significantly more pronounced for AD cells. In vivo, all animals revealed 
      peripheral multi-lineage chimerism at four weeks (P < 0.01) independent of cell 
      type and dosage. Regulatory T-cell levels were increased with both cell types, 
      the most in AD-MSC groups. These immunomodulatory effects were only transient. 
      MSC treatment resulted in long-term (>120 day) allograft survival in 47% of the 
      animals, which correlated with durable microchimerism in BM and spleen. 
      CONCLUSIONS: AD-MSCs and BM-MSCs exert immunomodulatory effects that prolong 
      survival of immunogenic skin-bearing VCA grafts with short course (21 day) 
      tacrolimus induction therapy. The in vivo findings in terms of allograft survival 
      did not reflect superior immunomodulatory characteristics of AD-MSCs found in 
      vitro.

TI  - Regulatory T cell expressed MyD88 is critical for prolongation of allograft 
      survival.
PG  - 930-40
LID - 10.1111/tri.12788 [doi]
AB  - MyD88 signaling directly promotes T-cell survival and is required for optimal 
      T-cell responses to pathogens. To examine the role of T-cell-intrinsic MyD88 
      signals in transplantation, we studied mice with targeted T-cell-specific MyD88 
      deletion. Contrary to expectations, we found that these mice were relatively 
      resistant to prolongation of graft survival with anti-CD154 plus rapamycin in a 
      class II-mismatched system. To specifically examine the role of MyD88 in Tregs, 
      we created a Treg-specific MyD88-deficient mouse. Transplant studies in these 
      animals replicated the findings observed with a global T-cell MyD88 knockout. 
      Surprisingly, given the role of MyD88 in conventional T-cell survival, we found 
      no defect in the survival of MyD88-deficient Tregs in vitro or in the transplant 
      recipients and also observed intact cell homing and expression of Treg effector 
      molecules. MyD88-deficient Tregs also fail to protect allogeneic bone marrow 
      transplant recipients from chronic graft-versus-host disease, confirming the 
      observations of defective regulation seen in a solid organ transplant system. 
      Together, our data define MyD88 as having a divergent requirement for cell 
      survival in non-Tregs and Tregs, and a yet-to-be defined survival-independent 
      requirement for Treg function during the response to alloantigen.

TI  - Expression of a Chimeric Antigen Receptor Specific for Donor HLA Class I Enhances 
      the Potency of Human Regulatory T Cells in Preventing Human Skin Transplant 
      Rejection.
PG  - 931-943
LID - 10.1111/ajt.14185 [doi]
AB  - Regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy using recipient-derived Tregs expanded ex vivo 
      is currently being investigated clinically by us and others as a means of 
      reducing allograft rejection following organ transplantation. Data from animal 
      models has demonstrated that adoptive transfer of allospecific Tregs offers 
      greater protection from graft rejection compared to polyclonal Tregs. Chimeric 
      antigen receptors (CAR) are clinically translatable synthetic fusion proteins 
      that can redirect the specificity of T cells toward designated antigens. We used 
      CAR technology to redirect human polyclonal Tregs toward donor-MHC class I 
      molecules, which are ubiquitously expressed in allografts. Two novel 
      HLA-A2-specific CARs were engineered: one comprising a CD28-CD3ζ signaling domain 
      (CAR) and one lacking an intracellular signaling domain (ΔCAR). CAR Tregs were 
      specifically activated and significantly more suppressive than polyclonal or ΔCAR 
      Tregs in the presence of HLA-A2, without eliciting cytotoxic activity. 
      Furthermore, CAR and ΔCAR Tregs preferentially transmigrated across 
      HLA-A2-expressing endothelial cell monolayers. In a human skin xenograft 
      transplant model, adoptive transfer of CAR Tregs alleviated the 
      alloimmune-mediated skin injury caused by transferring allogeneic peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells more effectively than polyclonal Tregs. Our results 
      demonstrated that the use of CAR technology is a clinically applicable refinement 
      of Treg therapy for organ transplantation.

TI  - Conservative management of full-thickness burn wounds using advanced moist 
      dressings: a case report.
PG  - E42-E46
LID - 10.25270/wnds/21030 [doi]
AB  - Surgical debridement and skin grafting are the standard of care in the management 
      of full-thickness burns. Although full-thickness burns typically are not managed 
      conservatively, such an approach may occasionally be warranted in cases of 
      small-area full-thickness burns in which the patient does not want to undergo an 
      operation. Published reports of conservative management in such cases are rare, 
      however. A case of a conservatively treated small-area full-thickness burn is 
      presented herein. Case Report. A 54-year-old female with left hemiplegia due to 
      the aftereffects of cerebral infarction sustained a full-thickness burn injury 
      measuring 7 cm × 18 cm on the left thigh when the patient fell indoors and came 
      in contact with a hot stove. The patient declined hospitalization and surgery. 
      Instead, conservative treatment with advanced moist dressings were used in an 
      outpatient setting. These multilayered, nonadherent dressings with high exudate 
      absorption capacity were changed once daily by the caregiver. No ointments were 
      applied to the wound. Five days after the injury, thick necrotic tissue covered 
      the entire wound. The patient wanted to avoid surgical procedures as much as 
      possible, so instead of surgical debridement, several superficial incisions were 
      made on the necrotic tissue to aid drainage of exudate. Autolysis of necrotic 
      tissue and growth of granulation tissue progressed over time. The burn wound 
      epithelialized after 16 weeks. No local or systemic infection occurred during the 
      treatment period. Conclusions. This case indicates that small-area full-thickness 
      burns can be successfully managed conservatively with advanced moist dressings, 
      although with a prolonged healing process compared with skin grafting.

AB  - B cells have been reported to promote graft rejection through alloantibody 
      production. However, there is growing evidence that B cells can contribute to the 
      maintenance of tolerance. Here, we used a mouse model of MHC-class I mismatched 
      skin transplantation to investigate the contribution of B cells to graft 
      survival. We demonstrate that adoptive transfer of B cells prolongs skin graft 
      survival but only when the B cells were isolated from mice housed in low 
      sterility "conventional" (CV) facilities and not from mice housed in pathogen 
      free facilities (SPF). However, prolongation of skin graft survival was lost when 
      B cells were isolated from IL-10 deficient mice housed in CV facilities. The 
      suppressive function of B cells isolated from mice housed in CV facilities 
      correlated with an anti-inflammatory environment and with the presence of a 
      different gut microflora compared to mice maintained in SPF facilities. Treatment 
      of mice in the CV facility with antibiotics abrogated the regulatory capacity of 
      B cells. Finally, we identified transitional B cells isolated from CV facilities 
      as possessing the regulatory function. These findings demonstrate that B cells, 
      and in particular transitional B cells, can promote prolongation of graft 
      survival, a function dependent on licensing by gut microflora.

AB  - CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells mediate immunological 
      self-tolerance and suppress immune responses. Retinoic acid (RA), a natural 
      metabolite of vitamin A, has been reported to enhance the differentiation of Treg 
      cells in the presence of TGF-β. In this study, we show that the co-culture of 
      naive T cells from C57BL/6 mice with allogeneic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) 
      from BALB/c mice in the presence of TGF-β, RA, and IL-2 resulted in a striking 
      enrichment of Foxp3(+) T cells. These RA in vitro-induced regulatory T (RA-iTreg) 
      cells did not secrete Th1-, Th2-, or Th17-related cytokines, showed a nonbiased 
      homing potential, and expressed several cell surface molecules related to 
      Treg-cell suppressive potential. Accordingly, these RA-iTreg cells suppressed 
      T-cell proliferation and inhibited cytokine production by T cells in in vitro 
      assays. Moreover, following adoptive transfer, RA-iTreg cells maintained Foxp3 
      expression and their suppressive capacity. Finally, RA-iTreg cells showed 
      alloantigen-specific immunosuppressive capacity in a skin allograft model in 
      immunodeficient mice. Altogether, these data indicate that functional and stable 
      allogeneic-specific Treg cells may be generated using TGF-β, RA, and IL-2. Thus, 
      RA-iTreg cells may have a potential use in the development of more effective 
      cellular therapies in clinical transplantation.

TI  - rFliC prolongs allograft survival in association with the activation of recipient 
      Tregs in a TLR5-dependent manner.
PG  - 206-14
LID - 10.1038/cmi.2013.44 [doi]
AB  - Allorejection remains an obstacle for successful organ transplantation. Although 
      different types of immunosuppressive agents are effective for controlling 
      rejection and prolonging graft survival, drug treatment is limited because of 
      side effects and toxicity. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to identify new 
      candidate drugs for inducing allotolerance. Recently, it has been reported that 
      bacterial flagellin induces the immunosuppressive activity of regulatory T cells 
      (Tregs) in humans in vitro. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of 
      recombinant flagellin (rFliC) on allograft survival and explored the underlying 
      mechanisms associated with the activation of recipient Tregs in a murine skin 
      allotransplantation model. The results showed that rFliC administration (3 mg/kg, 
      once per day for 3 days, i.p.) prolonged allograft survival (mean survival time: 
      18.4±1.1 days) compared to the control group (10±0.7 days, P<0.01). Additionally, 
      higher positive expression of Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) was detected within the 
      allograft administered with rFliC. The frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs; 
      the expression of Treg-related factors TLR5, Foxp3, TGF-β1 and IL-10; and the 
      proliferation and suppression of Tregs were increased following rFliC 
      administration compared to the control. Moreover, the increased expression of 
      tolerance-related molecules and the proliferation of Tregs induced by rFliC were 
      attenuated by an anti-TLR5 blocking antibody both in vivo and in vitro. In 
      conclusion, rFliC administration prolongs the survival of allografts, which is 
      associated with the activation of recipient Tregs in a TLR5-dependent manner. 
      rFliC may be a new candidate for anti-allorejection therapy.

TI  - Down-regulating cyclin-dependent kinase 9 of alloreactive CD4+ T cells prolongs 
      allograft survival.
PG  - 24983-94
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.8804 [doi]
AB  - CDK9 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 9)/Cyclin T1/RNA polymerase II pathway has been 
      demonstrated to promote the development of several inflammatory diseases, such as 
      arthritis or atherosclerosis, however, its roles in allotransplantation rejection 
      have not been addressed. Here, we found that CDK9/Cyclin T1 were apparently 
      up-regulated in the allogeneic group, which was positively correlated with 
      allograft damage. CDK9 was inhibited obviously in naive splenic CD4+ T cells 
      treated 6 h with 3 μM PHA767491 (a CDK9 inhibitor), and adoptive transfer of 
      these CD4+ T cells into allografted SCID mice resulted in prolonged survival 
      compared with the group without PHA767491 pretreated. Decelerated rejection was 
      correlated with enhanced IL-4 and IL-10 production and with decreased IFN-γ 
      production by alloreactive T cells. More interestingly, we found that CDK942, not 
      CDK955,was high expressed in allorejection group, which could be prominently 
      dampened with PHA767491 treatment. The expression of CDK942 was consistent with 
      its downstream molecule RNA polymerase II. Altogether, our findings revealed the 
      crucial role of CDK9/Cyclin T1/Pol II pathway in promoting allorejection at 
      multiple levels and may provide a new approach for transplantation tolerance 
      induction through targeting CDK9.

TI  - Porcine Islet-Specific Tolerance Induced by the Combination of Anti-LFA-1 and 
      Anti-CD154 mAbs Is Dependent on PD-1.
PG  - 327-42
LID - 10.3727/096368915X688506 [doi]
AB  - We previously demonstrated that short-term administration of a combination of 
      anti-LFA-1 and anti-CD154 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) induces tolerance to 
      neonatal porcine islet (NPI) xenografts that is mediated by regulatory T cells 
      (Tregs) in B6 mice. In this study, we examined whether the coinhibitory molecule 
      PD-1 is required for the induction and maintenance of tolerance to NPI 
      xenografts. We also determined whether tolerance to NPI xenografts could be 
      extended to allogeneic mouse or xenogeneic rat islet grafts since we previously 
      demonstrated that tolerance to NPI xenografts could be extended to second-party 
      NPI xenografts. Finally, we determined whether tolerance to NPI xenografts could 
      be extended to allogeneic mouse or second-party porcine skin grafts. Diabetic B6 
      mice were transplanted with 2,000 NPIs under the kidney capsule and treated with 
      short-term administration of a combination of anti-LFA-1 and anti-CD154 mAbs. 
      Some of these mice were also treated simultaneously with anti-PD-1 mAb at >150 
      days posttransplantation. Spleen cells from some of the tolerant B6 mice were 
      used for proliferation assays or were injected into B6 rag(-/-) mice with 
      established islet grafts from allogeneic or xenogeneic donors. All B6 mice 
      treated with anti-LFA-1 and anti-CD154 mAbs achieved and maintained normoglycemia 
      until the end of the study; however, some mice that were treated with anti-PD-1 
      mAb became diabetic. All B6 rag(-/-) mouse recipients of first- and second-party 
      NPIs maintained normoglycemia after reconstitution with spleen cells from 
      tolerant B6 mice, while all B6 rag(-/-) mouse recipients of allogeneic mouse or 
      xenogeneic rat islets rejected their grafts after cell reconstitution. Tolerant 
      B6 mice rejected their allogeneic mouse or xenogeneic second-party porcine skin 
      grafts while remaining normoglycemic until the end of the study. These results 
      show that porcine islet-specific tolerance is dependent on PD-1, which could not 
      be extended to skin grafts.

TI  - iNKT cell activation plus T-cell transfer establishes complete chimerism in a 
      murine sublethal bone marrow transplant model.
PG  - 328-340
LID - 10.1111/ajt.14453 [doi]
AB  - Transplant tolerance induction makes it possible to preserve functional grafts 
      for a lifetime without immunosuppressants. One powerful method is to generate 
      mixed hematopoietic chimeras in recipients by adoptive transfer of donor-derived 
      bone marrow cells (BMCs). In our murine transplantation model, we established a 
      novel method for mixed chimera generation using sublethal irradiation, CD40-CD40L 
      blockade, and invariant natural killer T-cell activation. However, numerous BMCs 
      that are required to achieve stable chimerism makes it difficult to apply this 
      model for human transplantation. Here, we show that donor-derived splenic T cells 
      could contribute to not only the reduction of BMC usage but also the 
      establishment of complete chimerism in model mice. By cotransfer of T cells 
      together even with one-fourth of the BMCs used in our original method, the 
      recipient mice yielded complete chimerism and could acquire donor-specific 
      skin-allograft tolerance. The complete chimeric mice did not show any remarks of 
      graft versus host reaction in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of the apoptotic 
      signal resulted in increase in host-derived CD8(+) T cells and chimerism brake. 
      These results suggest that donor-derived splenic T cells having veto activity 
      play a role in the depletion of host-derived CD8(+) T cells and the facilitation 
      of complete chimerism.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Complex Lower Extremity Reconstruction: 
      Outcomes and Costs for Biologically Based, Local Tissue Rearrangement, and Free 
      Flap Reconstruction.
PG  - 608e-616e
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000006589 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various surgical techniques exist for lower extremity reconstruction, 
      but limited high-quality data exist to inform treatment strategies. Using 
      multi-institutional data and rigorous matching, the authors evaluated the 
      effectiveness and cost of three common surgical reconstructive modalities. 
      METHODS: All adult subjects with lower extremity wounds who received bilayer 
      wound matrix, local tissue rearrangement, or free flap reconstruction were 
      retrospectively reviewed (from 2010 to 2017). Cohorts' comorbidities and wound 
      characteristics were balanced. Graft success at 180 days was the primary outcome; 
      readmissions, reoperations, and costs were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Five 
      hundred one subjects (166 matrix, 190 rearrangement, and 145 free flap patients) 
      were evaluated. Matched subjects (n = 312; 104/group) were analyzed. 
      Reconstruction success at 180 days for matrix, local tissue rearrangement, and 
      free flaps was 69.2 percent, 91.3 percent, and 93.3 percent (p < 0.001), and 
      total costs per subject were $34,877, $35,220, and $53,492 (p < 0.001), 
      respectively. Median length of stay was at least 2 days longer for free flaps (p 
      < 0.0001). Readmissions and reoperations were greater for free flaps. Local 
      tissue rearrangement, if achievable, provided success at low cost. Free flaps 
      were effective with large, traumatic wounds but at higher costs and longer length 
      of stay. Matrices successfully treated older, obese patients without exposed 
      bone. CONCLUSIONS: Lower extremity reconstruction can be performed effectively 
      using multiple modalities with varying degrees of success and costs. Local tissue 
      rearrangement and free flaps demonstrate success rates greater than 90 percent. 
      Bilayer wound matrix-based reconstruction effectively treats a distinct patient 
      population. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.

TI  - Immune Tolerance of Human Dental Pulp-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Mediated by 
      CD4⁺CD25⁺FoxP3⁺ Regulatory T-Cells and Induced by TGF-β1 and IL-10.
PG  - 1031-1039
LID - 10.3349/ymj.2017.58.5.1031 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Most studies on immune tolerance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have 
      been performed using MSCs derived from bone marrow, cord blood, or adipose 
      tissue. MSCs also exist in the craniofacial area, specifically in teeth. The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the mechanisms of immune tolerance of 
      dental pulp-derived MSC (DP-MSC) in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      isolated DP-MSCs from human dental pulp and co-cultured them with CD4⁺ T-cells. 
      To evaluate the role of cytokines, we blocked TGF-β and IL-10, separately and 
      together, in co-cultured DP-MSCs and CD4⁺ T-cells. We analyzed CD25 and FoxP3 to 
      identify regulatory T-cells (Tregs) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 
      and real-time PCR. We performed alloskin grafts with and without DP-MSC injection 
      in mice. We performed mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) to check immune 
      tolerance. RESULTS: Co-culture of CD4⁺ T-cells with DP-MSCs increased the number 
      of CD4⁺CD25⁺FoxP3⁺ Tregs (p<0.01). TGF-β or/and IL-10 blocking suppressed Treg 
      induction in co-cultured cells (p<0.05). TGF-β1 mRNA levels were higher in 
      co-cultured DP-MSCs and in co-cultured CD4⁺ T-cells than in the respective 
      monocultured cells. However, IL-10 mRNA levels were not different. There was no 
      difference in alloskin graft survival rate and area between the DP-MSC injection 
      group and the non-injection group. Nonetheless, MLR was reduced in the DP-MSC 
      injected group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: DP-MSCs can modulate immune tolerance by 
      increasing CD4⁺CD25⁺FoxP3⁺ Tregs. TGF-β1 and IL-10 are factors in the 
      immune-tolerance mechanism. Pure DP-MSC therapy may not be an effective treatment 
      for rejection, although it may module immune tolerance in vivo.

AB  - The dimeric cytokine IL-12 is important in the control of various infections but 
      also contributes to the pathology of certain diseases making it a potential 
      target for therapy. However, its specific inhibition with antibodies is 
      complicated by the fact that its two subunits are present in other cytokines: p40 
      in IL-23 and p35 in IL-35. This has led to erroneous conclusions like the alleged 
      implication of IL-12 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, we 
      report the development of a mouse anti-mouse IL-12 vaccine and the production of 
      monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that do not react with p40 or p35 (in IL-35) but 
      specifically recognize and functionally inhibit the IL-12 heterodimer. Using one 
      of these mAbs, MM12A1.6, that strongly inhibited IFN-γ production and LPS-induced 
      septic shock after viral infection, we demonstrate the critical role played by 
      IL-12 in the rejection of male skin graft by female C57BL/6 syngeneic recipients 
      and in the clearance of an immunogenic mastocytoma tumor variant by DBA/2 mice,

      was clearly prevented by anti-p40 mAb C17.8. Given this selective inhibition of 
      IL-12, these mAbs provide new options for reassessing IL-12 function in vivo.

TI  - Continuous Acquisition of MHC:Peptide Complexes by Recipient Cells Contributes to

PG  - 60-68
LID - 10.1111/ajt.13996 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the evolution of the direct and indirect pathways of 
      allorecognition following tissue transplantation is essential in the design of 
      tolerance-promoting protocols. On the basis that donor bone marrow-derived 
      antigen-presenting cells are eliminated within days of transplantation, it has 
      been argued that the indirect response represents the major threat to long-term 
      transplant survival, and is consequently the key target for regulation. However, 
      the detection of MHC transfer between cells, and particularly the capture of 
      MHC:peptide complexes by dendritic cells (DCs), led us to propose a third, 
      semidirect, pathway of MHC allorecognition. Persistence of this pathway would 
      lead to sustained activation of direct-pathway T cells, arguably persisting for 
      the life of the transplant. In this study, we focused on the contribution of 
      acquired MHC-class I on recipient DCs during the life span of a skin graft. We 
      observed that MHC-class I acquisition by recipient DCs occurs for at least 1 
      month following transplantation and may be the main source of alloantigen that 
      drives CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell responses. In addition, acquired MHC-class 
      I:peptide complexes stimulate T cell responses in vivo, further emphasizing the 
      need to regulate both pathways to induce indefinite survival of the graft.

TI  - Novel GMP-compatible protocol employing an allogeneic B cell bank for clonal 
      expansion of allospecific natural regulatory T cells.
PG  - 594-606
LID - 10.1111/ajt.12629 [doi]
AB  - The adoptive transfer of natural regulatory T cells (nTreg) is a new option to 
      reshape undesired immune reactivity in autoimmunity and transplantation toward 
      "tolerance." The first clinical trials using adoptive transfer of polyclonal 
      nTreg demonstrated safety and hints of efficacy. However, the low frequencies of 
      antigen-specific cells among the pool of polyclonal nTreg and their broad antigen 
      nonspecific suppression are limitations of this approach regarding efficacy and 
      safety. Recently, the isolation and expansion of (allo)antigen-specific nTreg 
      have successfully been achieved by using Treg-specific activation markers but the 
      yield is relatively low. Here, we describe a novel good manufacturing practice 
      (GMP)-compatible expansion protocol of alloantigen-specific nTreg based on the 
      stimulation of nTreg by allogeneic activated B cells. Their functionality and 
      specificity are superior compared to polyclonal nTreg both in vitro and in vivo. 
      Employing an allogeneic B cell bank, designed to cover the majority of HLA types, 
      allows fast GMP-compliant manufacturing for donor-specific nTreg for clinical 
      application in organ and stem cell transplantation. TCR repertoire analyses by 
      next generation sequencing revealed impressive expansion by several log-steps of 
      even very low-abundance alloantigen-specific nTreg clones. This novel method 
      offers a simple approach for expanding antigen-specific nTreg and is 
      characterized by high replicability and easy transferability to full GMP 
      standards.

PG  - 1086-96
LID - 10.1111/tri.12380 [doi]
AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that vascularized composite allografts (VCA) 
      could be accepted in a robust model of hematopoietic chimerism by injecting 
      allogeneic bone marrow cells (BMC) into swine fetuses. Outbred Yorkshire sows and 
      boars were screened to ensure the absence of the major histocompatibility (MHC) 
      allele SLA(cc) of inbred MGH miniature swine and then mated. Bone marrow 
      harvested from an SLA(cc) swine donor was T-cell depleted and injected 
      intravenously into the fetuses between days 50-55 of gestation. After birth, the 
      piglets were studied with flow cytometry to detect donor cells and mixed 
      lymphocyte reactions (MLR) and cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) assays to assess 
      their response to donor. Donor-matched VCAs from SLA(cc) donors were performed on 
      four chimeric and two nonchimeric swine. The results showed donor cell 
      engraftment and multilineage macrochimerism after the in utero transplantation of 
      adult BMC, and chimeric animals were unresponsive to donor antigens in vitro. 
      Both control VCAs were rejected by 21 days and were alloreactive. Chimeric 
      animals accepted the VCAs and never developed antidonor antibodies or 
      alloreactivity to donor. These results confirm that the intravascular, in utero 
      transplantation of adult BMC leads to donor cell chimerism and donor-specific 
      tolerance of VCAs across a full MHC barrier in this animal model.

AB  - Anti-lymphocyte-depleting antibodies have increasingly been utilized in the 
      clinic as induction therapy aiming to improve transplantation outcomes by 
      reducing the need for long-term immunosuppression. However, maintenance 
      immunosuppression is still required as lymphocyte reconstitution through 
      homeostatic proliferation, partially driven by IL-7, continues to replenish 
      tolerance-refractory immune cells capable of rejection. In murine models of MHC 
      mismatched skin grafting, we investigated whether it is feasible to control the 
      lymphocyte reconstitution process to delay rejection and favor tolerance 
      processes. We found that a short course of anti-IL-7 receptor blocking antibody 
      following T cell depletion, combined with the mammalian target of rapamycin 
      inhibitor Rapamycin, could significantly delay graft rejection in one mouse 
      strain, and achieve transplantation tolerance in another. The combination 
      treatment was found to delay T cell reconstitution and, in the short term, 
      enriched for Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), at the expense of effector cells. 
      Extended graft survival and tolerance were dependent on TGF-ß, indicating a role 
      for induced Tregs. These findings point to the feasibility of building on 
      lympholytic induction by guiding early lymphocyte reconstitution to favor 
      endogenous regulatory mechanisms.

TI  - Evaluation of Wound Healing Efficacy of an Antimicrobial Spray Dressing at Skin 
      Donor Sites.
PG  - 224-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Autologous skin transplantation is a common treatment for patients 
      with full-thickness burns. Postoperative wound care is essential for skin graft 
      donor and recipient sites, but traditional wound dressings such as cotton and 
      gauze do not form an effective barrier to bacteria, and patients can feel 
      uncomfortable when replacing dressings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The goal of this 
      study was to evaluate the use of an antimicrobial spray dressing (JUC Spray 
      Dressing, NMS Technologies Co Ltd, Nanjing, China), with respect to its 
      antimicrobial efficiency and the degree of pain experienced by patients. RESULTS: 
      The authors found the antimicrobial spray can reduce pain during the recovery 
      period, while providing equivalent antibacterial protection to the control 
      treatment (AQUACEL Hydrofiber Wound Dressing, ConvaTec, Bridgewater, NJ) based on 
      skin culture tests. The spray did not adversely affect the wound site recovery. 
      No significant side effects were present during the treatment period. CONCLUSION: 
      This antimicrobial spray could potentially be used in wound dressing 
      applications.

TI  - CD4+ T Cell Help Is Mandatory for Naive and Memory Donor-Specific Antibody 
      Responses: Impact of Therapeutic Immunosuppression.
PG  - 275

AB  - Antibody-mediated rejection is currently the leading cause of transplant failure. 
      Prevailing dogma predicts that B cells differentiate into anti-donor-specific 
      antibody (DSA)-producing plasma cells only with the help of CD4+ T cells. Yet, 
      previous studies have shown that dependence on helper T cells decreases when high 
      amounts of protein antigen are recruited to the spleen, two conditions 
      potentially met by organ transplantation. This could explain why a significant 
      proportion of transplant recipients develop DSA despite therapeutic 
      immunosuppression. Using murine models, we confirmed that heart transplantation, 
      but not skin grafting, is associated with accumulation of a high quantity of 
      alloantigens in recipients' spleen. Nevertheless, neither naive nor memory DSA 
      responses could be observed after transplantation of an allogeneic heart into 
      recipients genetically deficient for CD4+ T cells. These findings suggest that 
      DSA generation rather result from insufficient blockade of the helper function of 
      CD4+ T cells by therapeutic immunosuppression. To test this second theory, 
      different subsets of circulating T cells: CD8+, CD4+, and T follicular helper 
      [CD4+CXCDR5+, T follicular helper cells (Tfh)], were analyzed in 9 healthy 
      controls and 22 renal recipients. In line with our hypothesis, we observed that 
      triple maintenance immunosuppression (CNI + MMF + steroids) efficiently blocked 
      activation-induced upregulation of CD25 on CD8+, but not on CD4+ T cells. 
      Although the level of expression of CD40L and ICOS was lower on activated Tfh of 
      immunosuppressed patients, the percentage of CD40L-expressing Tfh was the same 
      than control patients, as was Tfh production of IL21. Induction therapy with 
      antithymocyte globulin (ATG) resulted in prolonged depletion of Tfh and reduction 
      of CD4+ T cells number with depleting monoclonal antibody in murine model 
      resulted in exponential decrease in DSA titers. Furthermore, induction with ATG 
      also had long-term beneficial influence on Tfh function after immune 
      reconstitution. We conclude that CD4+ T cell help is mandatory for naive and 
      memory DSA responses, making Tfh cells attractive targets for improving the 
      prevention of DSA generation and to prolong allograft survival. Waiting for 
      innovative treatments to be translated into the clinical field ATG induction 
      seems to currently offer the best clinical prospect to achieve this goal.

AB  - The effects of antithrombotic drugs on random and free flap survival have been 
      investigated in the past, but the experimental and clinical results are not in 
      agreement. A perforator-based critical ischaemia model was used to evaluate the 
      effects of different perioperatively administered pharmaceutical agents on tissue 
      ischaemia and to assess the potential additional haemorheological or vasodilative 
      effects of antithrombotics on flap microcirculation. Combined laser Doppler 
      flowmetry and remission spectroscopy revealed an increase in certain 
      microcirculation parameters in most groups in comparison with saline controls, 
      and these changes correlated with flap survival. Clopidogrel and hirudin 
      significantly improved the amount of viable flap tissue in comparison with 
      controls, while unfractioned heparin had a negative effect on flap survival. Low 
      molecular weight heparin, aspirin, pentoxifylline, and hydroxyethyl starch had no 
      impact on the amount of viable flap tissue. A higher complication rate was 
      observed in all experimental groups, but only clopidogrel had a negative impact 
      on the flap viability. Our results add to the body of evidence supporting the 
      conclusion that perioperative antithrombotic treatment improves flap survival. 
      Clopidogrel and hirudin are effective pharmacological agents that significantly 
      increased the viability of perforator-based skin flaps in rats, but at a higher 
      risk of postoperative bleeding.

TI  - Ilioinguinal Flap Combined With Tensor Fascia Lata Muscle Flap to Repair Deep 
      Electrical Burns in the Lower Abdomen: A Report of Two Cases.
PG  - E42-E45
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Electrical burns are caused by the conversion of electrical energy 
      flowing through the body into heat energy, which can cause coagulative necrosis 
      of the skin and deep tissues. Deep tissue damage is often more serious than skin 
      damage. Electrical burns have the characteristics of destructive and progressive 
      damage and present the common symptoms of severe local tissue damage accompanied 
      by a wide range of deep tissue necrosis, resulting in injury of nerves, blood 
      vessels, bones, and internal organs. Autologous skin grafting alone cannot 
      effectively cover deep tissues or repair electrical burn wounds. CASE REPORT: 
      This article describes 2 patients with deep electrical burns in the lower abdomen 
      that showed extensive skin and soft tissue damage, partial necrosis of abdominal 
      muscle tissue, and weak abdominal wall. As a single tissue flap was too small to 
      effectively cover the defect wound, ilioinguinal flap and tensor fascia lata 
      muscle flap were utilized in both cases with good outcomes. These flaps survived 
      completely, and the wounds were effectively repaired. After repair, the shape was 
      satisfactory, and the function of the lower abdomen was normal. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Transfer of flaps from a site near the wound for repairing electrical burns is 
      convenient for transfer with minimal surgical trauma and a simpler operating 
      procedure than the free flap.

TI  - A Skin-stretching Wound Closure System to Prevent and Manage Dehiscence of 
      High-tension Flap Donor Sites: A Report of 2 Cases.
PG  - 35-40
AB  - Tension on the suture line of flap donor sites raises the risk of delayed healing 
      and wound dehiscence. Closing a large flap donor site without a skin/flap graft 
      is a major surgical challenge. Recently, the authors started using a 
      skin-stretching wound closure system designed to harness both mechanical creep 
      and stress-relaxation principles for the management of a variety of surgically 
      closed wounds, including flap donor sites. The system consists of a pair of 
      attachment plates connected by a long, flexible approximation strap that can be 
      invasively (sutured) or noninvasively (by adhesion) secured to the skin wound 
      edges and gradually tightened. The care and outcomes of 2 of the 41 patients 
      whose wounds were managed with this system at the authors\'92 
      plastic/reconstructive and wound repair center during a period of 7 months are 
      described. The first case involved a 20-year-old patient with a 16 cm x 8 cm deep 
      inferior epigastric perforator flap to reconstruct a malignant tumor resection of 
      the groin. The second patient required a 10 cm x 8 cm anterolateral thigh 
      free-flap to repair a traumatic dorsal skin, soft tissue defect. Wounds were 
      assessed and tension adjusted every 2 or 3 days. Both lesions healed by primary 
      intention and with a good cosmetic outcome. Controlled clinical studies are 
      needed to examine the effectiveness, efficacy, indications, complications, and 
      cost effectiveness of this closure system.

TI  - Laser-assisted Fluorescent Angiography to Assess Tissue Perfusion in the Setting 
      of Traumatic Elbow Dislocation.
PG  - E93-E97
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the surgical setting, the most accepted technique for measuring 
      tissue perfusion includes subjective identification, with visual and tactile 
      inspections of the tissue, performed by a surgeon. Recently, fields such as 
      ophthalmology, plastic surgery, and other surgical specialties, such as cardiac, 
      vascular, and transplant surgery, have seen the emergence of laser-assisted 
      fluorescent angiography (LAFA) to visualize real-time tissue perfusion during 
      procedures. CASE REPORT: The case of an 80-year-old woman, who presented with a 
      wound over the left medial elbow following a subacute recurrent elbow 
      dislocation, illustrates the use of this technology in the field of orthopedics. 
      Initially, the patient was treated at an outside facility where the dislocation 
      was reduced, and she was placed in a long arm splint. With concern of recurrent 
      dislocation and wound development, she presented to the authors with a complex 
      wound measuring about 9 cm x 5 cm with variable thickness ranging from 0 mm to 5 
      mm in depth. Her initial emergent irrigation and debridement and wound management 
      was assisted by LAFA and the administration of indocyanine green to guide 
      debridement and determine viable wound margins. After staging with external 
      fixation and a negative pressure wound dressing, she later returned for skin 
      grafting and healed uneventfully. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with plastic 
      surgeons, the orthopaedic team utilized LAFA for debridement that led to both a 
      successful wound repair and skin grafting procedure.

      flap survival in a rat model.
PG  - S228-36
LID - 10.3346/jkms.2014.29.S3.S228 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a potent angiogenic factor that can stimulate 
      the production of blood vessels in ischemic tissue. We investigated whether gene 
      therapy using HGF-expressing adenovirus could enhance skin flap survival. 
      Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups. Rats were 
      subdermally injected with HGF-expressing adenovirus (HGF virus group), 
      recombinant HGF (rhHGF group), or phosphate buffered saline (PBS group) 2 days 
      before and immediately after 3 × 9 cm caudal flap elevation. The survival area of 
      the skin flap, the ratio of blood flow, CD31-positive vessels and, VEGF 
      expression were examined. Skin flap viability was significantly increased in the 
      HGF virus group compared to the rhHGF and PBS groups (71.4% ± 5.9%, 63.8%± 6.4%, 
      and 39.2% ± 13.0%, respectively) (P = 0.025). Furthermore, the blood flow ratio 
      was significantly increased in the HGF virus group. In the HGF virus group, the 
      number of CD31-positive vessels and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
      expression were significantly increased. Gene therapy using HGF-expressing 
      adenovirus increase VEGF expression, the number of viable capillaries, and blood 
      flow to the flap, thereby improving skin flap survival.

AB  - Anti-CD154 blockade-based regimens remain unequaled in prolonging graft survival 
      in various organ transplantation models. Several studies have focused on 
      transplantation tolerance with the anti-CD154 blockade, but none of these studies 
      has investigated the mechanisms associated with its use as the sole treatment in 
      animal models, delaying our understanding of anti-CD154 blockade-mediated immune 
      tolerance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism underlying 
      the anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb) blockade in inducing immune tolerance 
      using an intrahepatic murine allogeneic islet transplantation model. Allogeneic 
      BALB/c AnHsd (BALB/c) islets were infused into the liver of diabetic C57BL/6 (B6) 
      mice via the cecal vein. Anti-CD154 mAb (MR1) was administered on -1, 0, 1, 3, 5, 
      and 7 d posttransplantation at 0.5 mg per mouse. We showed that short-term MR1 
      monotherapy could prolong the allogeneic islet grafts to more than 250 d in the 
      murine intrahepatic islet transplantation model. The second islet grafts 
      transplanted under the kidney capsule of the recipients were protected from 
      rejection. We also found that rejection of same-donor skin grafts transplanted to 
      the tolerant mice was modestly delayed. Using a DEREG mouse model, FoxP3+ 
      regulatory T (Treg) cells were shown to play important roles in transplantation 
      tolerance. In mixed lymphocyte reactions, Treg cells from the tolerant mice 
      showed more potency in suppressing BALB/c splenocyte-stimulated Teff cell 
      proliferation than those from naïve mice. In this study, we demonstrated for the 
      first time that a short-term anti-CD154 mAb single treatment could induce FoxP3+ 
      Treg cell-mediated immune tolerance in the intrahepatic murine allogeneic islet 
      transplantation model.

TI  - Incidence and Predictors of Lower Limb Split-Skin Graft Failure and Primary 
      Closure Dehiscence in Day-Case Surgical Patients.
PG  - 775-83
LID - 10.1097/DSS.0000000000000391 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After general surgery, the lower limb experiences some of the highest 
      complication rates. However, little is known about contributing factors to 
      surgical site failure in the lower limb dermatological surgery population. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of lower limb surgical site failure and to 
      explore the predictors that contribute to surgical site failure. METHODS: A 
      prospective observational study design was used to collect data from 73 
      participants, from July 2010, to March 2012. Incidence was determined as a 
      percentage of surgical site failure from the total population. Predictors were 
      determined by the use of a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The 
      surgical site failure rate was 53.4%. Split-skin grafting had a higher failure 
      rate than primary closures, 66% versus 26.1%. Predictors of lower limb surgical 
      site failure were identified as increasing age (p = .04) and the presence of 
      postoperative hematoma (p = .01), with all patients who developed surgical site 
      infection experiencing surgical site failure (p = .01). CONCLUSION: Findings from 
      this study confirmed that the lower limb is at high risk of surgical site 
      failure. Two predictors of surgical site failure from this cohort were 
      determined. However, to understand this phenomenon and make recommendations to 
      assist and reduce surgical site complications, further research in this field is 
      required.

TI  - 2B4 (CD244) induced by selective CD28 blockade functionally regulates 
      allograft-specific CD8+ T cell responses.
PG  - 297-311
LID - 10.1084/jem.20130902 [doi]
AB  - Mounting evidence in models of both autoimmunity and chronic viral infection 
      suggests that the outcome of T cell activation is critically impacted by the 
      constellation of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptors expressed on the cell 
      surface. Here, we identified a critical role for the co-inhibitory SLAM family 
      member 2B4 (CD244) in attenuating primary antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell 
      responses in the presence of immune modulation with selective CD28 blockade. Our 
      results reveal a specific up-regulation of 2B4 on antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells 
      in animals in which CD28 signaling was blocked. However, 2B4 up-regulation was 
      not observed in animals treated with CTLA-4 Ig (abatacept) or CD28 blockade in 
      the presence of anti-CTLA-4 mAb. 2B4 up-regulation after CD28 blockade was 
      functionally significant, as the inhibitory impact of CD28 blockade was 
      diminished when antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells were deficient in 2B4. In 
      contrast, 2B4 deficiency had no effect on CD8(+) T cell responses during 
      unmodified rejection or in the presence of CTLA-4 Ig. We conclude that blockade 
      of CD28 signals in the presence of preserved CTLA-4 signals results in the unique 
      up-regulation of 2B4 on primary CD8(+) effectors, and that this 2B4 expression 
      plays a critical functional role in controlling antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell 
      responses.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of inactive form of platelet rich plasma (PRP) on 
      the flap viability. METHODS: Thirty six rats were used. Rats were divided into 
      six groups then 9x3 cm random pattern skin flaps were elevated from dorsum of all 
      rats. For precluding vascularization from the base, a silicone layer was placed 
      under the flap in groups 2(only flap+silicone), 4(saline+silicone) and 
      6(PRP+silicone). In groups 1(only flap), 2(only flap+silicone) nothing was done 
      except flap surgery. In groups 3(saline) and 4(saline+silicone), saline was 
      applied intradermally , in groups 5(PRP) and 6(PRP+silicone), inactive form of 
      PRP which obtained from different 16 rats was applied intradermally, into certain 
      points of flaps immediately after surgery. After 7 days flap necrosis ratio was 
      measured in all groups. RESULTS: Mean necrosis rate in group 5(PRP) (16.05%) was 
      statistically significantly lower than group 1(only flap) (31,93%) and group 
      3(saline) (30,43%) (p<0.001). Mean necrosis rate in group 6(PRP+silicone) 
      (36.37%) was statistically significantly lower than group 2(only flap+silicone) 
      (47.93%) and group 4(saline+silicone) (45.65%) (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Intradermal 
      inactive platelet rich plasma administration decreases flap necrosis so for skin 
      application.

AB  - Mycobacterium fortuitum is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium found in the soil and

TI  - Sarcoidosis and Wound Healing After Cellulitis of the Lower Limb: Is Methotrexate 
      Responsible for Skin Graft Failure?
PG  - 229-230
AB  - The authors report the case of a 53-year-old man with diffuse cutaneous and 
      mediastinal pulmonary sarcoidosis and well-controlled steroid-induced diabetes. 
      He was hospitalized for cellulitis of his left leg. His standard treatment for 
      sarcoidosis consisted of prednisone and methotrexate. Prednisone was stopped at 
      his admission. He received antibiotics for 4 weeks to treat the cellulitis. In 
      parallel, the leg wound was treated with daily silver sulfadiazine applications 
      until necrosis removal, then by skin autografting. Four successive procedures 
      were performed, but all failed despite lack of surgical problem or local 
      infection. Methotrexate was stopped after the fourth grafting procedure failed; 
      the fifth, and final, autografting procedure was successfully performed.

TI  - Circulating T follicular helper cells are a biomarker of humoral alloreactivity 
      and predict donor-specific antibody formation after transplantation.
PG  - 75-87
LID - 10.1111/ajt.15517 [doi]
AB  - Donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) contribute to renal allograft loss. However, 
      biomarkers to guide clinical management of DSA posttransplant or detect humoral 
      alloimmune responses before alloantibodies develop are not available. Circulating 
      T follicular helper (cTfh) cells are CD4(+) CXCR5(+) Tfh-like cells in the blood 
      that have been associated with alloantibodies in transplant recipients, but 
      whether they precede antibody formation for their evaluation as a predictive 
      biomarker in transplant is unknown. To evaluate the ability of cTfh cells to 
      predict DSA, we used murine transplant models to determine the temporal 
      relationship between cTfh cells, germinal center formation, and DSA development. 
      We observed that donor-reactive CD4(+) CXCR5(+) cTfh cells expand after 
      allotransplant. These cTfh cells were equivalent to graft-draining lymph 
      node-derived Tfh cells in their ability to provide B cell help for antibody 
      production. cTfh cell expansion and differentiation into ICOS(+) PD-1(+) cells 
      temporally correlated with germinal center alloreactivity and preceded the 
      generation of DSAs in instances of modified and unmodified alloantibody 
      formation. Importantly, delayed costimulation blockade initiated after the 
      detection of ICOS(+) PD-1(+) cTfh cells prevented DSAs. These findings suggest 
      that cTfh cells could serve as a biomarker for humoral alloreactivity before the 
      detection of alloantibodies and inform therapeutic approaches to prevent DSAs.

TI  - Minor Antigen Disparities Impede Induction of Long Lasting Chimerism and 
      Tolerance through Bone Marrow Transplantation with Costimulation Blockade.
PG  - 8635721
LID - 8635721
AB  - Mixed chimerism and tolerance can be successfully induced in rodents through 
      allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with costimulation blockade (CB), 
      but varying success rates have been reported with distinct models and protocols. 
      We therefore investigated the impact of minor antigen disparities on the 
      induction of mixed chimerism and tolerance. C57BL/6 (H2(b)) mice received 
      nonmyeloablative total body irradiation (3 Gy), costimulation blockade 
      (anti-CD40L mAb and CTLA4Ig), and 2 × 10(7) bone marrow cells (BMC) from either 
      of three donor strains: Balb/c (H2(d)) (MHC plus multiple minor 
      histocompatibility antigen (mHAg) mismatched), B10.D2 (H2(d)) or B10.A (H2(a)) 
      (both MHC mismatched, but mHAg matched). Macrochimerism was followed over time by 
      flow cytometry and tolerance was tested by skin grafting. 20 of 21 recipients of 
      B10.D2 BMC but only 13 of 18 of Balb/c BMC and 13 of 20 of B10.A BMC developed 
      stable long-term multilineage chimerism (p < 0.05 for each donor strain versus 
      B10.D2). Significantly superior donor skin graft survival was observed in 
      successfully established long-term chimeras after mHAg matched BMT compared to 
      mHAg mismatched BMT (p < 0.05). Both minor and major antigen disparities pose a 
      substantial barrier for the induction of chimerism while the maintenance of 
      tolerance after nonmyeloablative BMT and costimulation blockade is negatively 
      influenced by minor antigen disparities.        .

TI  - Ischemia-reperfusion injury in a rat microvascular skin free flap model: A 
      histological, genetic, and blood flow study.
PG  - e0209624
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0209624 [doi]
LID - e0209624
AB  - Ischemia reperfusion injury is associated with tissue damage and inflammation, 
      and is one of the main factors causing flap failure in reconstructive 
      microsurgery. Although ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a well-studied aspect 
      of flap survival, its biological mechanisms remain to be elucidated. To better 
      understand the biological processes of ischemia reperfusion injury, and to 
      develop further therapeutic strategies, the main objective of this study was to 
      identify the gene expression pattern and histological changes in an I/R injury 
      animal model. Fourteen rats (n = 7/group) were randomly divided into control or 
      ischemia-reperfusion group (8 hours of ischemia). Microsurgical anastomoses were 
      objectively assessed using transit-time-ultrasound technology. Seven days after 
      surgery, flap survival was evaluated and tissue samples were harvested for 
      anatomopathological and gene-expression analyses.The I/R injury reduced the 
      survival of free flaps and histological analyses revealed a subcutaneous edema 
      together with an inflammatory infiltrate. Interestingly, the Arginase 1 
      expression level as well as the ratio of Arginase 1/Nitric oxide synthase 2 
      showed a significant increase in the I/R group. In summary, here we describe a 
      well-characterized I/R animal model that may serve to evaluate therapeutic agents 
      under reproducible and controlled conditions. Moreover, this model could be 
      especially useful for the evaluation of arginase inhibitors and different 
      compounds of potential interest in reconstructive microsurgery.

AB  - Female mice of inbred strain CBA do not reject syngeneic male skin grafts even 
      though they mount a T-cell response against the male-specific HY antigen. We show 
      that local immunostimulation performed by injecting cytokines and Toll-like 
      receptor ligands in close vicinity to the graft causes rejection. We feel that 
      this approach should be tested in tumor-bearing human patients in combination 
      with antitumor vaccination. Relief of intratumor immunosuppression may increase 
      considerably the fraction of patients who respond to vaccination directed against 
      tumor antigens recognized by T cells.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the differences between the use of a 
      posterior interosseous artery (PIA) flap and an anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap 
      for post-traumatic, medium-sized soft tissue reconstruction of the hand based on 
      flap characteristics, postoperative complications, and aesthetic outcomes.From 
      October, 2010 to March, 2016, 62 patients undergoing soft tissue reconstruction 
      of the hand with 30 PIA flaps and 32 ALT flaps were included in this study. The 
      62 patients were divided into the PIA flap group and the ALT flap group. The 
      differences between the 2 groups were analyzed.The 62 patients included 52 males 
      and 10 females, and the mean age at the time of surgery was 41 years. The flap 
      failure rate was 13.3% (4/30) in the PIA flap group and 9.4% (3/32) in the ALT 
      flap group. No significant differences in flap failure rate, recipient site 
      complication rate, or donor site complication rate were observed between the 2 
      groups. However, the operative time (136 min vs 229 min) and aesthetic outcomes 
      (flap bulk swelling, 0 cases vs 31 cases) were statistically significantly 
      different.Both the pedicled PIA flap and the free ALT flap were comparable for 
      the reconstruction of post-traumatic, medium-sized soft tissue defects of the 
      hand according to the evaluated outcomes of postoperative complications. Based on 
      the surgical characteristics of the flap and the evaluation of aesthetic 
      outcomes, the pedicled PIA flap was significantly superior to the free ALT flap.

TI  - Risk factors of pelvic pressure ulcer recurrence after primary skin flap surgery 
      in people with spinal cord injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Flap surgery for deep pelvic pressure ulcers (PPUs) has been found 
      effective, but the recurrence rate remains high and few risk factors have been 
      identified. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated risk factors for PU recurrence after primary 
      flap surgery in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 
      observational retrospective study based on medical charts included all 
      individuals with SCI who underwent primary flap surgery for a PPU in the Hérault 
      department in France between 2006 and 2014. Overall, 100 biomedical, 
      psychological, socioeconomic and care management factors were studied. The 
      primary outcome was PPU recurrence (surgical site and/or other pelvic site). The 
      secondary outcome was recurrence at the surgical site. Cox proportional hazards 
      regression was used to determine associated factors, estimating hazard ratios 
      (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We included 85 patients. Half 
      had a PPU recurrence, and in one-third, the recurrence was at the surgical site. 
      On multivariate analysis, global PPU recurrence was associated with colostomy 
      (HR=2.79) and living with a partner (HR=2.29). Non-traumatic SCI and sacral wound 
      were associated with PPU recurrence (HR=3.39, HR=0.48) and recurrence at the 
      surgical site (HR=3.3, HR=0.3). CONCLUSION: Risk factors of PPU recurrence are 
      based on both biomedical and social models. After primary flap surgery, the risk 
      of recurrence justifies regular follow-up and strict monitoring.

TI  - Vitamin C Fosters the In Vivo Differentiation of Peripheral CD4(+) Foxp3(-) T 
      Cells into CD4(+) Foxp3(+) Regulatory T Cells but Impairs Their Ability to 
      Prolong Skin Allograft Survival.
PG  - 112

AB  - Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical players of immunological tolerance due to 
      their ability to suppress effector T cell function thereby preventing transplant 
      rejection and autoimmune diseases. During allograft transplantation, increases of 
      both Treg expansion and generation, as well as their stable function, are needed 
      to ensure allograft acceptance; thus, efforts have been made to discover new 
      molecules that enhance Treg-mediated tolerance and to uncover their mechanisms. 
      Recently, vitamin C (VitC), known to regulate T cell maturation and dendritic 
      cell-mediated T cell polarization, has gained attention as a relevant epigenetic 
      remodeler able to enhance and stabilize the expression of the Treg master 
      regulator gene Foxp3, positively affecting the generation of induced Tregs 
      (iTregs). In this study, we measured VitC transporter (SVCT2) expression in 
      different immune cell populations, finding Tregs as one of the cell subset with 
      the highest levels of SVCT2 expression. Unexpectedly, we found that VitC 
      treatment reduces the ability of natural Tregs to suppress effector T cell 
      proliferation in vitro, while having an enhancer effect on TGFβ-induced Foxp3(+) 
      Tregs. On the other hand, VitC increases iTregs generation in vitro and in vivo, 
      however, no allograft tolerance was achieved in animals orally treated with VitC. 
      Lastly, Tregs isolated from the draining lymph nodes of VitC-treated and 
      transplanted mice also showed impaired suppression capacity ex vivo. Our results 
      indicate that VitC promotes the generation and expansion of Tregs, without 
      exhibiting CD4(+) T cell-mediated allograft tolerance. These observations 
      highlight the relevance of the nutritional status of patients when immune 
      regulation is needed.

TI  - The Knife's Edge of Tolerance: Inducing Stable Multilineage Mixed Chimerism but 
      With a Significant Risk of CMV Reactivation and Disease in Rhesus Macaques.
PG  - 657-670
LID - 10.1111/ajt.14006 [doi]
AB  - Although stable mixed-hematopoietic chimerism induces robust immune tolerance to 
      solid organ allografts in mice, the translation of this strategy to large animal 
      models and to patients has been challenging. We have previously shown that in 
      MHC-matched nonhuman primates (NHPs), a busulfan plus combined belatacept and 
      anti-CD154-based regimen could induce long-lived myeloid chimerism, but without T 
      cell chimerism. In that setting, donor chimerism was eventually rejected, and 
      tolerance to skin allografts was not achieved. Here, we describe an adaptation of 
      this strategy, with the addition of low-dose total body irradiation to our 
      conditioning regimen. This strategy has successfully induced multilineage 
      hematopoietic chimerism in MHC-matched transplants that was stable for as long as 
      24 months posttransplant, the entire length of analysis. High-level T cell 
      chimerism was achieved and associated with significant donor-specific 
      prolongation of skin graft acceptance. However, we also observed significant 
      infectious toxicities, prominently including cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation 
      and end-organ disease in the setting of functional defects in anti-CMV T cell 
      immunity. These results underscore the significant benefits that multilineage 
      chimerism-induction approaches may represent to transplant patients as well as 
      the inherent risks, and they emphasize the precision with which a clinically 
      successful regimen will need to be formulated and then validated in NHP models.

TI  - Quality of life and patient satisfaction after implant-based breast 
      reconstruction with or without acellular dermal matrix: randomized clinical 
      trial.
PG  - 811-820
LID - 10.1002/bjs5.50324 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) in implant-based breast reconstructions 
      (IBBRs) aims to improve cosmetic outcomes. Six-month data are presented from a 
      randomized trial evaluating whether IBBR with ADM provides higher health-related 
      quality of life (HRQoL) and patient-reported cosmetic outcomes compared with 
      conventional IBBR without ADM. METHODS: In this multicentre open-label RCT, women 
      with breast cancer planned for mastectomy with immediate IBBR in four centres in 
      Sweden and one in the UK were allocated randomly (1 : 1) to IBBR with or without 
      ADM. HRQoL, a secondary endpoint, was measured as patient-reported outcome 
      measures (PROMs) using three validated instruments (EORTC-QLQC30, QLQ-BR23, 
      QLQ-BRR26) at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS: Between 24 April 2014 and 10 May 
      2017, 135 women were enrolled, of whom 64 with and 65 without ADM were included 
      in the final analysis. At 6 months after surgery, patient-reported HRQoL, 
      measured with generic QLQ-C30 or breast cancer-specific QLQ-BR23, was similar 
      between the groups. For patient-reported cosmetic outcomes, two subscale items, 
      cosmetic outcome (8·66, 95 per cent c.i. 0·46 to 16·86; P = 0·041) and problems 
      finding a well-fitting bra (-13·21, -25·54 to -0·89; P = 0·038), yielded higher 
      scores in favour of ADM, corresponding to a small to moderate clinical 
      difference. None of the other 27 domains measured showed any significant 
      differences between the groups. CONCLUSION: IBBR with ADM was not superior in 
      terms of higher levels of HRQoL compared with IBBR without ADM. Although two 
      subscale items of patient-reported cosmetic outcomes favoured ADM, the majority 
      of cosmetic items showed no significant difference between treatments at 
      6 months. Registration number: NCT02061527 ( www.clinicaltrials.gov).

TI  - Unique Presentation of Orf Virus Infection in a Thermal-Burn Patient After 
      Receiving an Autologous Skin Graft.
PG  - 1171-4
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiw307 [doi]
AB  - We describe a burn patient who developed skin lesions on her skin-graft harvest 
      and skin-graft recipient (burn) sites. Orf virus infection was confirmed by a 
      combination of diagnostic assays, including molecular tests, immunohistochemical 
      analysis, pathologic analysis, and electron microscopy. DNA sequence analysis 
      grouped this orf virus isolate among isolates from India. Although no definitive 
      source of infection was determined from this case, this is the first reported 
      case of orf virus infection in a skin graft harvest. Skin graft recipients with 
      exposures to animals may be at risk for this viral infection.

TI  - Negative pressure wound therapy does not decrease postoperative wound 
      complications in patients undergoing mastectomy and flap fixation.

AB  - Patients and breast cancer surgeons are frequently confronted with wound 
      complications after mastectomy. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a 
      promising technique for preventing wound complications after skin closure in 
      elective surgery. However, a clinical study evaluating postoperative 
      complications following the use of NPWT, focusing solely on closed incisions in 
      patients undergoing mastectomy, has yet to be performed. Between June 2019 and 
      February 2020, 50 consecutive patients underwent mastectomy with NPWT during the 
      first seven postoperative days. This group was compared to a cohort of patients 
      taking part in a randomized controlled trial between June 2014 and July 2018. 
      Primary outcome was the rate of postoperative wound complications, i.e. surgical 
      site infections, wound necrosis or wound dehiscence during the first three 
      postoperative months. Secondary outcomes were the number of patients requiring 
      unplanned visits to the hospital and developing clinically significant seroma 
      (CSS). In total, 161 patients were analyzed, of whom 111 patients in the control 
      group (CON) and 50 patients in the NPWT group (NPWT). Twenty-eight percent of the 
      patients in the NPWT group developed postoperative wound complications, compared 
      to 18.9% in the control group (OR = 1.67 (95% CI 0.77-3.63), p = 0.199). The 
      number of patients requiring unplanned visits or developing CSS was not 
      statistically significant between the groups. This study suggests that Avelle 
      negative pressure wound therapy in mastectomy wounds does not lead to fewer 
      postoperative wound complications. Additionally, it does not lead to fewer 
      patients requiring unplanned visits or fewer patients developing clinically 
      significant seromas.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03942575.

TI  - Effectiveness of collagen/oxidised regenerated cellulose/silver-containing 
      composite wound dressing for the treatment of medium-depth split-thickness skin 
      graft donor site wounds in multi-morbid patients: a prospective, non-comparative, 
      single-centre study.
PG  - 791-800
LID - 10.1111/iwj.12698 [doi]
AB  - Split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) is a widely used method in reconstructive 
      surgery, but donor site wounds (DSWs) are often slow healing and painful. This 
      prospective study evaluated the performance of a composite wound dressing 
      containing collagen/oxidised regenerated cellulose in the treatment of 
      medium-depth (0·4 mm) DSWs in 25 multi-morbid patients with chronic leg ulcers 
      requiring STSG. The range of patients' ages was 44-84 years (mean 71·6 years) 
      with DSW sizes ranging between 12 and 162 cm(2) (mean 78 cm(2) ). Comorbidities 
      included anticoagulation therapy (15 patients), anaemia (11 patients), diabetes 
      (6 patients) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ulcer 
      colonisation (6 patients). The first dressing change was performed after 10 days. 
      Complete reepithelialisation was observed between the 10th and 34th day (mean 
      17·2, median 14 days). Postoperative medium to strong bleeding occurred in only 
      five patients (four with anticoagulation). Wound pain levels one day after 
      harvesting were only moderate (range 0-1·5, mean 0·5, median 0·5 on a six-item 
      scale). No wound infection was observed during the first dressing. The composite 
      dressing used allowed for the fast healing of medium-depth DSWs with minimal or 
      no postoperative pain and bleeding in older multi-morbid patients under 
      anticoagulation treatment.

TI  - Use of negative-pressure wound therapy and split-thickness skin autograft to

AB  - Exposure of a renal transplant through the abdominal wall is a rare event. A 
      search of the literature reveals only six documented cases which used skin 
      autograft for coverage, with none reported since 1981, and none which used 
      negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) to prepare the recipient bed. This case 
      report demonstrates that NPWT followed by split thickness skin graft is a 
      reconstructive option which is feasible in patients who are at high risk for 
      surgical complications in prolonged flap surgery.

AB  - We report herein application of an in situ material strategy to attenuate 
      allograft T cell responses in a skin transplant mouse model. Functionalized 
      peptidic membranes were used to impede trafficking of donor antigen-presenting 
      cells (dAPCs) from skin allografts in recipient mice. Membranes formed by 
      self-assembling peptides (SAPs) presenting antibodies were found to remain 
      underneath grafted skins for up to 6 days. At the host-graft interface, dAPCs 
      were targeted by using a monoclonal antibody that binds to a class II major 
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule (I-A(d)) expressed exclusively by donor 
      cells. Using a novel cell labeling near-infrared nanoemulsion, we found more 
      dAPCs remained in allografts treated with membranes loaded with anti-I-A(d) 
      antibodies than without. In vitro, dAPCs released from skin explants were found 
      adsorbed preferentially on anti-I-A(d) antibody-loaded membranes. Recipient T 
      cells from these mice produced lower concentrations of interferon-gamma cultured 
      ex vivo with donor cells. Taken together, the data indicate that the strategy has 
      the potential to alter the natural course of rejection immune mechanisms in 
      allogeneic transplant models.

TI  - Selective CD28 Blockade Results in Superior Inhibition of Donor-Specific T 
      Follicular Helper Cell and Antibody Responses Relative to CTLA4-Ig.
PG  - 89-101
LID - 10.1111/ajt.14400 [doi]
AB  - Donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) are a barrier to improved long-term outcomes 
      after kidney transplantation. Costimulation blockade with CTLA4-Ig has shown 
      promise as a potential therapeutic strategy to control DSAs. T follicular helper 
      (Tfh) cells, a subset of CD4(+) T cells required for optimal antibody production, 
      are reliant on the CD28 costimulatory pathway. We have previously shown that 
      selective CD28 blockade leads to superior allograft survival through improved 
      control of CD8(+) T cells relative to CTLA4-Ig, but the impact of CD28-specific 
      blockade on CD4(+) Tfh cells is unknown. Thus, we identified and characterized 
      donor-reactive Tfh cells in a murine skin transplant model and then used this 
      model to evaluate the impact of selective CD28 blockade with an anti-CD28 domain 
      antibody (dAb) on the donor-specific Tfh cell-mediated immune response. We 
      observed that the anti-CD28 dAb led to superior inhibition of donor-reactive 
      CXCR5(+) PD-1(high) Tfh cells, CD95(+) GL7(+) germinal center B cells and DSA 
      formation compared with CTLA4-Ig. Interestingly, donor-reactive Tfh cells 
      differentially upregulated CTLA4 expression, suggesting an important role for 
      CTLA4 in mediating the superior inhibition observed with the anti-CD28 dAb. 
      Therefore, selective CD28 blockade as a novel approach to control Tfh cell 
      responses and prevent DSA after kidney transplantation warrants further study.

TI  - Complement component 3 deficiency prolongs MHC-II disparate skin allograft 
      survival by increasing the CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells population.
PG  - 33489
LID - 10.1038/srep33489 [doi]
LID - 33489
AB  - Recent reports suggest that complement system contributes to allograft rejection. 
      However, its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Herein, we investigate 
      the role of complement component 3 (C3) in a single MHC-II molecule mismatched 
      murine model of allograft rejection using C3 deficient mice (C3(-/-)) as skin 
      graft donors or recipients. Compared with C3(+/+) B6 allografts, C3(-/-) B6 
      grafts dramatically prolonged survival in MHC-II molecule mismatched H-2(bm12) B6 
      recipients, indicating that C3 plays a critical role in allograft rejection. 
      Compared with C3(+/+) allografts, both Th17 cell infiltration and Th1/Th17 
      associated cytokine mRNA levels were clearly reduced in C3(-/-) allografts. 
      Moreover, C3(-/-) allografts caused attenuated Th1/Th17 responses, but increased 
      CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cell expression markedly in local 
      intragraft and H-2(bm12) recipients. Depletion of Treg cells by anti-CD25 
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) negated the survival advantages conferred by C3 
      deficiency. Our results indicate for the first time that C3 deficiency can 
      prolong MHC-II molecule mismatched skin allograft survival, which is further 
      confirmed to be associated with increased CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg cell population 
      expansion and attenuated Th1/Th17 response.

TI  - PD-1/PD-L1 Interaction Maintains Allogeneic Immune Tolerance Induced by 
      Administration of Ultraviolet B-Irradiated Immature Dendritic Cells.
PG  - 2419621
LID - 10.1155/2016/2419621 [doi]
LID - 2419621
AB  - Our previous study demonstrated that transfusion of ultraviolet B-irradiated 
      immature dendritic cells (UVB-iDCs) induced alloantigen-specific tolerance 
      between two different strains of mice. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed 
      death ligand-1 (PD-L1) have been suggested to play an important role in 
      maintaining immune tolerance. In the present study, we seek to address whether 
      PD-1/PD-L1 plays a role in the maintenance of UVB-iDC-induced tolerance. We first 
      observe that the UVB-iDC-induced alloantigen-specific tolerance can be maintained 
      for over 6 weeks. Supporting this, at 6 weeks after tolerance induction 
      completion, alloantigen-specific tolerance is still able to be transferred to 
      syngeneic naïve mice through adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, skin 
      transplantation study shows that the survival of allogeneic grafts is prolonged 
      in those tolerant recipients. Further studies show that PD-1/PD-L1 interaction is 
      essential for maintaining the induced tolerance as blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 by 
      anti-PD-L1 antibodies largely breaks the tolerance at both cellular and humoral 
      immunological levels. Importantly, we show that PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in 
      tolerant mice is also essential for controlling alloantigen-responding T cells, 
      which have never experienced alloantigens. The above findings suggest that 
      PD-1/PD-L1 plays a crucial role in maintaining immune tolerance induced by 
      UVB-iDCs, as well as in actively controlling effector T cells specific to 
      alloantigens.

TI  - Evaluation of Epidermal Skin Grafts for the Treatment of Complex Wounds in a 
      Wound Care Center: A 94-Patient Case Series.
PG  - 347-353
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, a new technology for autologous epidermal harvesting 
      has been developed to produce epidermal skin grafts (ESGs) for use over wounds. 
      This technology employs negative pressure and heat to raise the epidermal skin 
      layer, allowing for consistent and reproducible epidermal harvesting. The aim of 
      this case series is to present the authors' experience using an automated, 
      epidermal harvesting system to produce ESGs to treat wounds of patients with 
      multiple comorbidities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case series was conducted 
      between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2014. Patients with wounds (≤ 25 cm2) 
      that failed to heal were treated with ESGs by a group of 3 wound care physicians 
      in 2 outpatient wound care centers in a community health center setting. RESULTS: 
      A total of 94 patients with 102 wounds were identified. Of the 94 patients, 3 
      were noncompliant and 9 were lost to follow-up. Therefore, 82 patients with 90 
      wounds were included in the analysis. The majority of wounds demonstrated 
      epithelialization (83/90, 92.2%). Of the 90 wounds, 75 (83.3%) healed following 
      epidermal grafting, 4 (4.4%) wounds displayed improvement, and 11 (12.2%) did not 
      heal. Minimal or no pain at the donor site was reported by the patients, and all 
      donor sites healed without complications. CONCLUSION: This case series provides 
      additional evidence for the use of ESGs for the treatment of wounds that fail to 
      heal.

TI  - 1 Versus 2-cm Excision Margins for pT2-pT4 Primary Cutaneous Melanoma (MelMarT): 
      A Feasibility Study.
PG  - 2541-2549
LID - 10.1245/s10434-018-6470-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus regarding optimal surgical excision 
      margins for primary cutaneous melanoma > 1 mm in Breslow thickness (BT). A 
      narrower surgical margin is expected to be associated with lower morbidity, 
      improved quality of life (QoL), and reduced cost. We report the results of a 
      pilot international study (MelMarT) comparing a 1 versus 2-cm surgical margin for 
      patients with primary melanoma > 1 mm in BT. METHODS: This phase III, multicentre 
      trial [NCT02385214] administered by the Australia & New Zealand Medical Trials 
      Group (ANZMTG 03.12) randomised patients with a primary cutaneous melanoma > 1 mm 
      in BT to a 1 versus 2-cm wide excision margin to be performed with sentinel lymph 
      node biopsy. Surgical closure technique was at the discretion of the treating 
      surgeon. Patients' QoL was measured (FACT-M questionnaire) at baseline, 3, 6, and 
      12 months after randomisation. RESULTS: Between January 2015 and June 2016, 400 
      patients were randomised from 17 centres in 5 countries. A total of 377 patients 
      were available for analysis. Primary melanomas were located on the trunk (56.9%), 
      extremities (35.6%), and head and neck (7.4%). More patients in the 2-cm margin 
      group required reconstruction (34.9 vs. 13.6%; p < 0.0001). There was an 
      increased wound necrosis rate in the 2-cm arm (0.5 vs. 3.6%; p = 0.036). After 
      12 months' follow-up, no differences were noted in QoL between groups. 
      DISCUSSION: This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a large 
      international RCT to provide a definitive answer to the optimal excision margin 
      for patients with intermediate- to high-risk primary cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - The results of the treatment of hand - Outcomes of the treatment of hand 
      degloving injuries with greater omentum flaps.
PG  - 20-27
LID - 10.5604/01.3001.0013.5495 [doi]
AB  - Degloving injury consists in tearing out the soft-tissue integument from skeleton 
      of the hand, with accompanied nerves and vessels. The whole hand degloving has 
      bad reputation and one of worst prognosis, even worse than total hand amputation. 
      The range of possible salvage procedures in these cases is limited and their 
      outcomes are unsatisfactory. One of the suitable methods is wrapping the skinned 
      hand with pedicled or free greater omentum flap, retrieved from the abdominal 
      cavity. The article reports outcomes of the treatment of 5 patients at a mean of 
      8 years after total degloving of their hands and coverage with omental flaps. All 
      flaps healed uneventfully, but in none of the patients the whole length of the 
      fingers was preserved. Division of stumps of 3 fingers was possible in one 
      patient, two others had three-digital hands and remaining two had only separated 
      thumb. Dexterity of injured hands was limited with a mean of score DASH 
      questionnaire of 43 points. Quality of life as measured by SF-36 questionnaire 
      was fair (58 and 53 points in physical and mental domain, respectively). 
      Regardless this, all patients were satisfied with achieved outcomes and all 
      returned to work, which was a confirmation of the effectiveness of the method 
      used in their treatment.

TI  - Interim pressure garment therapy (4-6 mmHg) and its effect on donor site healing 
      in burn patients: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 214
LID - 10.1186/s13063-016-1329-x [doi]
LID - 214
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure garment therapy (PGT) is well accepted and commonly used by 
      clinicians in the treatment of burns scars and grafts. The medium to high 
      pressures (24-40 mmHg) in these garments can support scar minimisation, and 
      evidence is well documented for this particular application. However, PGT 
      specifically for burn donor sites, of which a sequela is also scarring, is not 
      well documented. This study protocol investigates the impact of a low pressure 
      (4-6 mmHg) interim garment on donor site healing and scarring. With a primary 
      purpose of holding donor dressings in place, the application of the interim 
      pressure garment (IPG) appears to have been twofold. IPGs for donor sites have 
      involved inconsistent application with a focus on securing wound dressing rather 
      than scar management. However, anecdotal and observational evidence suggests that 
      IPGs also make a difference to some patient's scar outcomes for donor sites. This 
      study protocol outlines a randomised controlled trial designed to test the 
      effectiveness of this treatment on reducing scarring to burn donor sites. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a single-centre, single (assessor)-blinded, 
      randomised control trial in patients with burns donor sites to their thighs. 
      Patients will be randomly allocated to a control group (with no compression to 
      donor sites) or to an experimental group (with compression to donor sites) as the 
      comparative treatment. Groups will be compared at baseline regarding the 
      important prognostic indicators: donor site location, depth, size, age, and time 
      since graft (5 days). The IPG treatment will be administered post-operatively (on 
      day 5). Follow-up assessments and garment replacement will be undertaken 
      fortnightly for a period of 2 months. DISCUSSION: This study focuses on a unique 
      area of burns scar management using a low-pressure tubular support garment for 
      the reduction of donor site scars. Such therapy specifically for donor scar 
      management is poorly represented in the literature. This study was designed to 
      test a potentially cost-effective scar prevention for patients with donor sites 
      to the thigh. No known studies of this nature have been carried out to date, and 
      there is a need for rigorous clinical evidence for low-pressure support garments 
      for donor site scar minimisation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand

TI  - A novel rat full-thickness hemi-abdominal wall/hindlimb osteomyocutaneous 
      combined flap: influence of allograft mass and vascularized bone marrow content 
      on vascularized composite allograft survival.
PG  - 977-86
LID - 10.1111/tri.12364 [doi]
AB  - Vascularized bone marrow transplantation (VBMT) appears to promote tolerance for 
      vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA). However, it is unclear whether 
      VBMT is critical for tolerance induction and, if so, whether there is a finite 
      amount of VCA that VBMT can support. We investigated this with a novel VCA 
      combined flap model incorporating full-thickness hemiabdominal wall and hindlimb 
      osteomyocutaneous (HAW/HLOMC) flaps. Effects of allograft mass (AM) and VBMT on 
      VCA outcome were studied by comparing HAW/HLOMC VCAs with fully MHC-mismatched BN 
      donors and Lewis recipients. Control groups did not receive treatments following 
      transplantation. Treatment groups received a short course of cyclosporine A 
      (CsA), antilymphocyte serum, and three doses of adipocyte-derived stem cells (POD 
      1, 8, and 15). The results showed that all flaps in control allogeneic groups 
      rejected soon after VCAs. Treatment significantly prolonged allograft survival. 
      Three of eight recipients in HLOMC treatment group had allografts survive 
      long-term and developed donor-specific tolerance. Significantly higher peripheral 
      chimerism was observed in HLOMC than other groups. It is concluded that the 
      relative amount of AM to VBMT is a critical factor influencing long-term 
      allograft survival. Accordingly, VBMT content compared with VCA mass may be an 
      important consideration for VCA in humans.

AB  - Complicated epidermoid cysts (ECs) occur commonly on the back, but few reports 
      have described their management. We present our experience in managing patients 
      with ECs on the back using a keystone-design perforator island flap (KDPIF) 
      reconstruction, thereby focusing on reduction and redistribution of wound 
      tension. Altogether, 15 patients (average age, 48.067 ± 14.868 years) underwent 
      KDPIF reconstructions after complete excision of complicated ECs on the back. We 
      retrospectively reviewed the medical records and clinical photographs of all 
      patients. Final scar appearance was evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar 
      Assessment Scale (POSAS). All patients had ruptured ECs, while 6 patients also 
      had cellulitis of the surrounding tissues. All defects, after complete excision 
      of ECs and debridement of surrounding unhealthy tissues, were successfully 
      covered with KDPIF. The mean 'tension-change' at the defect and donor sites was 
      -4.73 ± 0.21 N and -4.88 ± 0.25 N, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean 'rate of 
      tension-change' at the defect and donor sites was -69.48 ± 1.7% and 
      -71.16 ± 1.33%, respectively (p < 0.001). All flaps survived with no 
      postoperative complications. The mean observer scar assessment scale (OSAS) 
      summary score and patient scar assessment scale (PSAS) total score were 
      14.467 ± 5.069 and 15.6 ± 6.512, respectively. Overall, we suggest that KDPIF 
      reconstruction is a good surgical modality for the management of complicated ECs 
      on the back.

TI  - Failure of Dermal Allograft Repair of Massive Rotator Cuff Tears in Magnetic 
      Resonance Imaging and Clinical Assessment.
PG  - 200-207
LID - 10.4055/cios.2019.11.2.200 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Massive retracted rotator cuff tears represent a therapeutic dilemma, 
      particularly in the young and middle-aged patients who are not appropriate for a 
      reverse total shoulder replacement. Interposition grafting using human dermal 
      allograft offers an alternative treatment. METHODS: A retrospective review of all 
      patients who underwent interposition grafting using human dermal allograft 
      between December 2013 and May 2015 for massive rotator cuff tears at our tertiary 
      referral center was performed. Preoperative and 6 month postoperative magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) assessments were performed in all patients, with 
      postoperative graft integrity being the primary outcome measure. Clinical 
      evaluation was performed using the Oxford shoulder score, Constant score, and 
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score. RESULTS: The mean age at 
      the time of follow-up was 54 years. On MRI, 84% of grafts were seen to have 
      failed at 6 months. Strength was grossly reduced on the operative side when 
      supraspinatus and subscapularis were tested; despite this, Constant score (mean, 
      48.2) was comparable to that in the previous reports. DASH and Oxford scores were 
      a mean of 24.94 and 37.16, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, in 
      particular the MRI findings, we cannot advocate the use of dermal allograft as an 
      interposition graft for the repair of massive rotator cuff tears.

TI  - Synergism of Therapies After Postoperative Autograft Failure in a Patient With 
      Melanoma of the Foot Misdiagnosed as a Pressure Ulcer.
PG  - E41-E43
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Amelanotic melanoma of the foot is a diagnostic challenge for 
      physicians as it often appears as a benign lesion. In order to make the correct 
      diagnosis at early stages, it is recommended to perform a biopsy of worsening 
      lesions that are refractory to standard treatments, particularly nonhealing 
      wounds. CASE REPORT: The authors describe the case of a 57-year-old man with 
      amelanotic melanoma of the foot that had been treated as a pressure ulcer for 3 
      months. He underwent wide local excision of the melanoma and an application of 
      skin autograft. After skin autograft failure, optimal wound bed preparation was 
      achieved through negative pressure wound therapy and compression bandages 
      associated with hyperbaric therapy. Complete wound healing was obtained with an 
      epidermal fractional skin grafting system combined with compressive inelastic 
      bandages. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians must remain highly cautious of ulcerated 
      lesions of the foot and may consider epidermal fractional skin grafting as a 
      valid therapeutic option in case of postsurgical wounds resulting from wide local 
      excision of malignant melanomas.

TI  - Reduction of ARNT in myeloid cells causes immune suppression and delayed wound 
      healing.
PG  - C349-57
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00306.2013 [doi]
AB  - Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is a transcription factor 
      that binds to partners to mediate responses to environmental signals. To 
      investigate its role in the innate immune system, floxed ARNT mice were bred with 
      lysozyme M-Cre recombinase animals to generate lysozyme M-ARNT (LAR) mice with 
      reduced ARNT expression. Myeloid cells of LAR mice had altered mRNA expression 
      and delayed wound healing. Interestingly, when the animals were rendered 
      diabetic, the difference in wound healing between the LAR mice and their 
      littermate controls was no longer present, suggesting that decreased myeloid cell 
      ARNT function may be an important factor in impaired wound healing in diabetes. 
      Deferoxamine (DFO) improves wound healing by increasing hypoxia-inducible 
      factors, which require ARNT for function. DFO was not effective in wounds of LAR 
      mice, again suggesting that myeloid cells are important for normal wound healing 
      and for the full benefit of DFO. These findings suggest that myeloid ARNT is 
      important for immune function and wound healing. Increasing ARNT and, more 
      specifically, myeloid ARNT may be a therapeutic strategy to improve wound 
      healing.

TI  - Donor bone marrow cells are essential for iNKT cell-mediated Foxp3+ Treg cell 
      expansion in a murine model of transplantation tolerance.
PG  - 734-742

AB  - Mixed chimerism induction is the most reliable method for establishing 
      transplantation tolerance. We previously described a novel treatment using a 
      suboptimal dose of anti-CD40 ligand (anti-CD40L) and liposomal formulation of a 
      ligand for invariant natural killer T cells administered to sub-lethally 
      irradiated recipient mice after donor bone marrow cell (BMC) transfer. Recipient 
      mice treated with this regimen showed expansion of a Foxp3-positive regulatory 
      T(Treg) cell phenotype, and formation of mixed chimera. However, the mechanism of 
      expansion and bioactivity of Treg cells remains unclear. Here, we examine the 
      role of donor BMCs in the expansion of bioactive Treg cells. The mouse model was 
      transplanted with a heart allograft the day after treatment. The results showed 
      that transfer of spleen cells in place of BMCs failed to deplete host interferon 
      (IFN)-γ-producing CD8(+) T cells, expand host Ki67(+) CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) 
      Treg cells, and prolong graft survival. Severe combined immunodeficiency mice who 
      received Treg cells obtained from BMC-recipients accepted skin grafts in an 
      allo-specific manner. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which were a copious cell 
      subset in BMCs, enhanced the Ki67 expression of Treg cells. This suggests that 
      donor BMCs are indispensable for the expansion of host bioactive Treg cells in 
      our novel treatment for transplant tolerance induction.

AB  - A man aged 47 years who was immunosuppressed following renal transplantation for 
      focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was referred to the Plastic Surgery team for 
      management of a painful, chronic, granulomatous lesion of the right forearm. 
      Serial ultrasound scans and MRI scans were not diagnostic, but microbiological 
      specimens tested positive for the fungus Scedosporium apiospermum The renal 
      transplant graft-which was failing-was removed, allowing him to cease 
      immunosuppression. He then underwent a resection of the lesion and reconstruction 
      with a split thickness skin graft. Analysis of the specimen revealed fibrosis, 
      granulomatosis and a collection of S. apiospermum He was started on voriconazole 
      which, in conjunction with his surgical resection, appears to have kept the 
      disease at bay. With increasing numbers of solid organ transplants and improved 
      survival, this case highlights the growing burden of rare, opportunistic 
      infections, the difficulty in diagnosis and the need for specialist intervention.

TI  - Revision surgery with dermal regeneration template and vacuum sealing drainage 
      for reconstruction of complex wounds following necrosis of reattached avulsed 
      skins in a degloving injury: A case report.
PG  - e15864

LID - e15864
AB  - RATIONALE: Degloving injury of the upper limb often extends to underlying tendons 
      and bone, which is at high risk of treatment failure if only simple reattachment 
      of defatted avulsed skins was performed. Pelnac dermal regeneration template 
      could be used as a treatment choice for necrosis of the reattached avulsed skins 
      in a degloving injury. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 48-year-old woman with a degloving 
      injury of the right forearm, wrist, and hand received initial treatment by 
      reattachment of the defatted avulsed skins over the wound bed. However, 17 days 
      postoperatively, the reattached skins developed complete necrosis, leaving large 
      size of tissue defects and tendon/bone exposure. DIAGNOSIS: Failure to 
      reconstruct the skin and soft-tissue envelop by reattachment of the defatted 
      avulsed skins in a severe degloving injury of the upper limb. INTERVENTIONS: We 
      decided to use a 2-stage procedure of Pelnac dermal regeneration template and 
      secondary skin graft to solve this issue, in consideration of these conditions 
      and the patient' demanding of limb function and aesthetic appearance. OUTCOMES: 
      At the final follow-up, this patient obtained an excellent result, in term of 
      scar quality, aesthetic appearance, and the ability to perform the daily 
      activities. LESSONS: We believe this could become an interesting option in 
      patients who needed revision procedure for management of complex wounds with 
      tendon/bone exposure following the necrosis of reattached skins in degloving 
      injuries.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Marjolin' s ulcer, an aggressive ulcerating squamous cell 
      carcinoma, is a well-known phenomenon that occurs in chronically inflamed or 
      scarred tissue; however, squamous cell carcinoma arising in the acute setting 
      after tissue trauma - specifically autograft donor harvest sites for burns - is a 
      rare, but notable event. METHODS: This case series describes three instances of 
      squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed in split-thickness skin graft donor sites in 
      the immediate post-operative period. Charts were reviewed in detail after at 
      least 9 months follow-up from identification of the tumor. Detailed descriptions 
      of each case are included. A discussion of the literature on this rare entity is 
      included as well. RESULTS: In the three cases discussed, all were characterized 
      clinically as painful masses arising in a recently healed donor site. Two were 
      managed surgically with adherence to oncologic principals. One lesion regressed 
      or fell off spontaneously. With at least 9 months follow-up, there was no 
      evidence of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Very few cases of acute neoplasm in donor 
      sites have been described in the literature. Presently, there is no dominant 
      theory as to how these lesions arise; however, this is an entity that burn care 
      providers, world wide should be aware of, with a low threshold for oncologic 
      evaluation if suspected.

TI  - Notch-Expanded Murine Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells Mitigate Death from 
      Lethal Radiation and Convey Immune Tolerance in Mismatched Recipients.
PG  - 566-575
LID - 10.5966/sctm.2016-0112 [doi]
AB  - The hematopoietic syndrome of acute radiation syndrome (h-ARS) is characterized 
      by severe bone marrow aplasia, resulting in a significant risk for bleeding, 
      infections, and death. To date, clinical management of h-ARS is limited to 
      supportive care dictated by the level of radiation exposure, with a high 
      incidence of mortality in those exposed to high radiation doses. The ideal 
      therapeutic agent would be an immediately available, easily distributable 
      single-agent therapy capable of rapid in vivo hematopoietic reconstitution until 
      recovery of autologous hematopoiesis occurs. Using a murine model of h-ARS, we 
      herein demonstrate that infusion of ex vivo expanded murine hematopoietic stem 
      and progenitor cells (HSPCs) into major histocompatibility complex mismatched 
      recipient mice exposed to a lethal dose of ionizing radiation (IR) led to rapid 
      myeloid recovery and improved survival. Survival benefit was significant in a 
      dose-dependent manner even when infusion of the expanded cell therapy was delayed 
      3 days after lethal IR exposure. Most surviving mice (80%) demonstrated long-term 
      in vivo persistence of donor T cells at low levels, and none had evidence of 
      graft versus host disease. Furthermore, survival of donor-derived skin grafts was 
      significantly prolonged in recipients rescued from h-ARS by infusion of the 
      mismatched expanded cell product. These findings provide evidence that ex vivo 
      expanded mismatched HSPCs can provide rapid, high-level hematopoietic 
      reconstitution, mitigate IR-induced mortality, and convey donor-specific immune 
      tolerance in a murine h-ARS model. Stem Cells Translational Medicine

TI  - Use of disposable negative pressure wound therapy on split-thickness skin graft 
      recipient sites for peripheral arterial disease foot wounds: A case report.
PG  - 716-721
LID - 10.1111/iwj.13291 [doi]
AB  - Split-thickness skin graft (STSG) helps to promote healing of wounds by providing 
      a viable soft tissue cover. However, the success of which is influenced by how 
      well it takes to the recipient site. Studies have demonstrated that negative 
      pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an excellent modality to promote graft survival. 
      Technological advancements have made possible the invention of disposable, 
      ultraportable, and mechanically operated versions for improved user experience. 
      Alas, little has been discussed about their benefits on STSG. Therefore, the 
      purpose of this case report is to highlight the effective use of disposable NPWT 
      on freshly applied STSG. We report here a novel use of the disposable NPWT (SNAP 
      therapy system) for STSG recipient sites in two patients with peripheral arterial 
      disease (PAD) foot wounds. In both patients, there was 100% STSG uptake, and the 
      lightweight disposable NPWT system makes for a more cost-effective and 
      comfortable experience for patients. Disposable NPWT may be a feasible 
      alternative to conventional NPWT to aid with STSG uptake for PAD foot wound 
      recipient sites.

PG  - 174-9
AB  - Prescription drug abuse ranks as the second most common class of illicit drug use 
      in the United States, and one mechanism of opiate abuse involves intravenous 
      injection of enteral narcotics such as oxycodone or hydrocodone. The authors 
      describe a patient who sustained significant soft tissue necrosis after 
      intravenously injecting a solution made from crushed enteral narcotics, with a 
      focus on the operative course that resulted due to a delay in initial definitive 
      treatment. The patient's wounds encompassed 8% total body surface area and 
      covered 247 cm2. A 55-year-old female was admitted to the burn unit (West Penn 
      Burn Center, Western Pennsylvania Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA) after she initially 
      presented with infection and cellulitis to her bilateral upper extremities 3 
      weeks after intravenously injecting herself with crushed oxycodone/acetaminophen. 
      She underwent numerous sequential operative repairs including initial 
      debridement, placement of dermal replacement templates, and several 
      split-thickness autografts and xenografts. Her total length of stay was 59 days, 
      broken into an initial 47-day stay, and a subsequent 12-day readmission due to 
      graft failure secondary to poor follow-up. As the number of prescription drug 
      abusers rises, it is possible that an increase in attempts to intravenously abuse 
      enteral narcotics may also rise. As such, burn centers should be prepared for the 
      extent of potential limb necrosis and the operative treatment that may ensue.

AB  - This is a case of a 31-year-old Filipino man with chronic methamphetamine use 
      disorder who developed tetanus from a necrotic skin graft over his left 
      calcaneus, which was fractured after a motor vehicular accident. During the 
      course of his illness, the patient's muscle spasms were unusually refractory to 
      benzodiazepine, which is the first-line drug used in the management of muscle 
      spasms. The muscle spasms were successfully controlled on the seventh day of 
      illness with rocuronium at a dose of 10 μg/kg/min and midazolam at 
      0.30 mg/kg/hour. Both infusions were tapered off until the 23rd day of illness. 
      The patient was discharged on the 30th day of illness, improved and stable.

AB  - PURPOSE: Complex contaminated or infected abdominal wall defects present a 
      particularly challenging problem to the surgeon. The aim of this study was to 
      describe our experience with human acellular dermal matrix (ADM) in incarcerated 
      abdominal wall herniorrhaphy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 63 
      patients (51 males and 12 females) who underwent emergency surgery for acute 
      incarcerated abdominal wall hernias with ADM repair, between June 2008 and 
      October 2011 at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University. RESULTS: 
      All hernias were repaired with an intraperitoneal underlay repair and received a 
      high-vacuum wound drainage system after herniorrhaphy. 19 patients underwent 
      reinforced repair with component separation. Over a median follow-up period of 32 
      (range 13-58) months, the recurrence rate was 4.8%. Two patients developed 
      bulges, one developed a hematoma, one developed a seroma, and one had a 
      superficial wound infection. No patients developed fistulae, intestinal 
      obstruction, abdominal pain, or stiffness of the abdominal wall postoperatively. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the use of ADM as a biological mesh combined 
      with high-vacuum wound drainage system in complex abdominal wall reconstruction 
      is acceptable without major side effects.

PG  - 1032-45
LID - 10.1111/ajt.12650 [doi]
AB  - CD4(+) Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs ) are essential for maintaining 
      immunological tolerance, which could be harnessed for novel cell-based therapies 
      to prevent allograft rejection and control autoimmunity. However, the use of 
      Tregs for therapy is hindered by the inability to generate sufficient cell 
      numbers to inhibit desired immune response(s) and achieve stable engraftment of 
      the donor-Treg cell inoculums. The present study was undertaken to investigate 
      the in vivo requirements to promote engraftment of adoptively transferred Tregs 
      and induce tolerance. We established that not only is peripheral space required, 
      but competition from endogenous Tregs must be minimized for successful donor-Treg 
      engraftment with IL-2 critical for driving their proliferation and survival. 
      Moreover, these studies revealed a critical level of donor-Treg engraftment was 
      required for tolerance induction to skin transplants. These mouse studies lay the 
      foundation for development of novel Treg approaches for tolerance induction in 
      the clinic involving not only organ or cellular transplantation, but also to 
      re-establish self-tolerance in autoimmune settings.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap is the most popularly used flap 
      for major soft tissue reconstruction. Although it is widely used, acute 
      compartment syndrome (ACS) in pediatric patients has rarely been reported in the 
      literature. We herein reported a case of ACS in a 6-year-old girl after ALT flap 
      harvest with direct closure of the donor site. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 6-year-old 
      girl was admitted to the Second Hospital of Jilin University with crush injury on 
      the palmar aspect of the right hand and wrist. DIAGNOSIS: Examination showed soft 
      tissue defect of the hand and wrist, damage on the thenar muscles, lightly 
      crushed flexor tendons, crushed median nerve, and ulnar artery thrombosis. 
      INTERVENTIONS: The defect was closed with an ipsilateral ALT flap measuring 9 cm 
      in length by 6 cm in width. OUTCOMES: After debridement was performed 3 times, 
      the majority of the rectus femoris and lateral femoris were removed. Secondary 
      closure by skin grafting was performed 2 weeks later. Three days after the 
      procedure, necrotic tissues were noted on the edges of the wound. The diagnosis 
      of ACS of the right was made. A second exploration was decided, and an extensive 
      anterior compartment fasciotomy was performed. After 6 weeks of vacuum sealing 
      drainage therapy, the defect was closed with a free latissimus dorsi 
      musculocutaneous flap. At 4 months of follow-up, the right thigh wound had 
      healed. At 6 months of follow-up, quadriceps muscle weakness remained. At 1 year 
      of follow-up, the patient's mobility had been significantly improved, but 
      diminished sensation remained on the lateral aspect of the thigh. CONCLUSION: ACS 
      can occur after ALT flap harvesting in pediatric patients and should be 
      recognized as early as possible to avoid devastating complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracodorsal artery perforator (TDAP) flap is one of the relatively 
      new techniques in breast reconstruction. This pedicled flap retains the benefits 
      of perforator flaps as regards minimal donor site morbidity without the need for 
      microvascular anastomosis. Its role in partial breast reconstruction has been 
      well documented. However, there are few reports about the role of this flap in 
      total breast reconstruction. METHODS: This study included 47 cases who presented 
      to the breast unit of the National Cancer Institute of Cairo University from 2013 
      to 2015. All patients underwent nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate 
      implant-based reconstruction. The TDAP flap was used to complete the subpectoral 
      pocket for the implants in a way similar to the acellular dermal matrix. RESULTS: 
      Overall complication rate was 14.9%. Capsular contracture occurred in 6.4%.There 
      were no donor site complications. The majority of patients were satisfied with 
      their cosmetic results. Sixty-eight percent rated their result as "excellent" or 
      "good." CONCLUSION: Thoracodorsal artery perforator flap can play a significant 
      role in total breast reconstruction. In settings with limited resources, this 
      flap can serve as an available autologous alternative to acellular dermal matrix.

TI  - Efficacy of Hydrofiber Silver Dressing in the Treatment of Posttraumatic Skin 
      Wounds in Children.
PG  - 239-43
AB  - Three case reports on conservative treatment of posttraumatic open conquassant 
      wounds in children are presented. In 2 cases, the wounds opened after rejection 
      of a previously applied skin graft, whereas in the third case, the wound was 
      consequential to toe amputation and treated conservatively. Based on the authors' 
      long-standing favorable experience with this type of dressing in healing of deep 
      burns in children, treatment was continued with the use of a hydrofiber 
      supportive silver-containing dressing (AQUACEL Ag, ConvaTec, Bridgewater, NJ). 
      From the beginning of treatment, wound dressing was performed on an outpatient 
      basis and without antibiotic therapy. The wounds healed within 4-8 weeks. The 
      process of wound healing and treatment, the mechanisms that may compromise it, 
      and the possibilities offered by hydrofiber silver dressing in conservative 
      treatment of posttraumatic conquassant skin wounds are discussed.

TI  - Clonal Deletion Established via Invariant NKT Cell Activation and Costimulatory 
      Blockade Requires In Vivo Expansion of Regulatory T Cells.
PG  - 426-39
LID - 10.1111/ajt.13493 [doi]
AB  - Recently, the immune-regulating potential of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) 
      cells has attracted considerable attention. We previously reported that a 
      combination treatment with a liposomal ligand for iNKT cells and an anti-CD154 
      antibody in a sublethally irradiated murine bone marrow transplant (BMT) model 
      resulted in the establishment of mixed hematopoietic chimerism through in vivo 
      expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Herein, we show the lack of 
      alloreactivity of CD8(+) T cells in chimeras and an early expansion of 
      donor-derived dendritic cells (DCs) in the recipient thymi accompanied by a 
      sequential reduction in the donor-reactive Vβ-T cell receptor repertoire, 
      suggesting a contribution of clonal deletion in this model. Since thymic 
      expansion of donor DCs and the reduction in the donor-reactive T cell repertoire 
      were precluded with Treg depletion, we presumed that Tregs should preform before 
      the establishment of clonal deletion. In contrast, the mice thymectomized before 
      BMT failed to increase the number of Tregs and to establish CD8(+) T cell 
      tolerance, suggesting the presence of mutual dependence between the thymic 
      donor-DCs and Tregs. These results provide new insights into the regulatory 
      mechanisms that actively promote clonal deletion.

TI  - Polyclonal Recipient nTregs Are Superior to Donor or Third-Party Tregs in the 
      Induction of Transplantation Tolerance.
PG  - 562935

AB  - Induction of donor-specific tolerance is still considered as the "Holy Grail" in 
      transplantation medicine. The mixed chimerism approach is virtually the only 
      tolerance approach that was successfully translated into the clinical setting. We 
      have previously reported successful induction of chimerism and tolerance using 
      cell therapy with recipient T regulatory cells (Tregs) to avoid cytotoxic 
      recipient treatment. Treg therapy is limited by the availability of cells as 
      large-scale expansion is time-consuming and associated with the risk of 
      contamination with effector cells. Using a costimulation-blockade based bone 
      marrow (BM) transplantation (BMT) model with Treg therapy instead of 
      cytoreductive recipient treatment we aimed to determine the most potent Treg 
      population for clinical translation. Here we show that CD4(+)CD25(+) in vitro 
      activated nTregs are superior to TGFβ induced iTregs in promoting the induction 
      of chimerism and tolerance. Therapy with nTregs (but not iTregs) led to 
      multilineage chimerism and donor-specific tolerance in mice receiving as few as 
      0.5 × 10(6) cells. Moreover, we show that only recipient Tregs, but not donor or 
      third-party Tregs, had a beneficial effect on BM engraftment at the tested doses. 
      Thus, recipient-type nTregs significantly improve chimerism and tolerance and 
      might be the most potent Treg population for translation into the clinical 
      setting.

AB  - This study analyses the epidemiologic data and the bacteriologic results of a 
      total number of 759 burned patients, which were treated and discharged from the 
      Plastic Surgery Department of the County Emergency Hospital of Ploiesti, between 
      01 01 2010 and 31 12 2013. The investigated parameter shave been: age and gender 
      distribution, rural or urban population, burn etiology, total burn surface area 
      (TBSA),TBSA, location and depth of lesions, therapeutic management,length of 
      hospital stay, types of bacteria isolated from the infected wounds and their 
      sensitivity to antibiotics, patients' mortality. The statistical analysis 
      revealed the following results: mean age 51.33 ± 18.44 years, male/female ratio 
      1.35/1, rural/urban ratio 1.34/1, most common etiologies were scalds (44.8%) and 
      flames (37.6%), mean TBSA 7.7 ± 8.4%, main locations were the extremities, 
      splitthickness skin grafting in 15% of the patients, hospital stay 15.57 ± 13.84 
      days, main bacteria isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.3%) and 
      Staphylococcus aureus (22.9%), mortality rate 0.13%. The best methods to decrease 
      the burn morbidity are the burn and infection prevention, for which several 
      measures are discussed.

TI  - Dynamic reconstruction of complex abdominal wall defects with the pedicled 
      innervated vastus lateralis and anterolateral thigh PIVA flap.
PG  - 837-45

LID - 10.1016/j.bjps.2015.03.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Reconstruction of large and chronically infected recurrent 
      abdominal wall defects with exposed bowel in a scarred wound environment, when 
      component release has been previously performed but failed, is a veritable 
      challenge. We use a pedicled innervated vastus lateralis muscle with a 
      fasciocutaneous anterolateral thigh flap (PIVA flap) to restore the continuity of 
      the abdominal wall with vascularised tissues and create a dynamic component that 
      improves the functional outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A one-stage PIVA flap was 
      used in 15 patients with grade 4 transmural chronically infected defects. They 
      had a mean of 4.53 previous laparotomies and important co-morbidities. We 
      determined post-operative reconstructive abdominal wall strength using a 
      validated quality-of-life (QoL) hernia-related questionnaire and modified it to 
      quantify donor-site morbidity at the thigh. We measured the maximal force 
      generated at 60°/s and the force velocity at 120°/s by isokinetic dynamometric 
      analysis at 3 and 12 months. Electromyography (EMG) was performed 12 months after 
      the reconstruction to analyse the contractile integrity of the vastus lateralis 
      segment. A two-sided sign test was used to analyse data. RESULTS: All transmural 
      chronic wounds healed without recurrence. Dynamometric strength increased 
      significantly in the abdominal wall musculature (p < 0.016) and in the donor 
      thigh (p < 0.023) between 3 months and 12 months after the intervention, which 
      reflected in the EMG outcome and the high scores in the QoL measurements after 12 
      months. CONCLUSIONS: The PIVA flap revascularises the scarred milieu, adds a 
      dynamic component to improve function and may reach up to the xiphoid process. 
      Donor-site morbidity is limited.

TI  - The operative treatment of pressure sores in the pelvic region: A 10-year period 
      overview.
PG  - 432-8
LID - 10.1179/2045772314Y.0000000266 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Pelvic region pressure sores often develop following spinal cord injury. 
      Surgery is often necessary for long standing, large-sized pressure sores not 
      responding to conservative treatment. Authors analyze their results of a 10-year 
      period, and identify factors contributing to the reduction of the recurrence 
      rate. METHODS: A total of 119 pressure sores were operated on 98 patients in two 
      institutions during a 10-year period (1 January 2003 to 31 December 2012). The 
      encountered perioperative complications are summarized, and the recurrence rate 
      is analyzed with a patient follow-up questionnaire. RESULTS: We experienced 15 
      perioperative complications (12.6%). All complications were fully resolved by 
      conservative treatment. Fifty-eight returned patient replies were processed. The 
      average follow-up time after surgery was 5.2 years. The recurrence rate was 
      5.47%. CONCLUSION: The strict adherence to surgical indications, full patient 
      compliance, specialized pre- and post-operative patient care, our routinely used 
      preferred surgical method, all contribute to a low post-operative complication 
      rate, long-term flap survival, and an extended recurrence free period.

TI  - NAD(+) regulates Treg cell fate and promotes allograft survival via a systemic 
      IL-10 production that is CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T cells independent.
PG  - 22325
LID - 10.1038/srep22325 [doi]
LID - 22325
AB  - CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) Tregs have been shown to play a central role in immune 
      homeostasis while preventing from fatal inflammatory responses, while Th17 cells 
      have traditionally been recognized as pro-inflammatory mediators implicated in a 
      myriad of diseases. Studies have shown the potential of Tregs to convert into 
      Th17 cells, and Th17 cells into Tregs. Increasing evidence have pointed out CD25 
      as a key molecule during this transdifferentiation process, however molecules 
      that allow such development remain unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of 
      NAD(+) on the fate of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) Tregs in-depth, dissected their 
      transcriptional signature profile and explored mechanisms underlying their 
      conversion into IL-17A producing cells. Our results demonstrate that NAD(+) 
      promotes Treg conversion into Th17 cells in vitro and in vivo via CD25 cell 
      surface marker. Despite the reduced number of Tregs, known to promote 
      homeostasis, and an increased number of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells, NAD(+) was 
      able to promote an impressive allograft survival through a robust systemic IL-10 
      production that was CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) independent. Collectively, our study 
      unravels a novel immunoregulatory mechanism of NAD(+) that regulates Tregs fate 
      while promoting allograft survival that may have clinical applications in 
      alloimmunity and in a wide spectrum of inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Submental island flap reconstruction reduces cost in oral cancer reconstruction 
      compared to radial forearm free flap reconstruction: a case series and cost 
      analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Canada, 4,400 cases of oral cancer are diagnosed yearly. Surgical 
      resection is a key component of treatment in many of these cancers. 
      Reconstruction of defects, with the goal of preserving function, is of utmost 
      importance. Several choices are possible for reconstruction of larger defects, 
      including both free and pedicled flaps. Free flap reconstruction is reliable and 
      effective, but requires additional personnel and peri-operative resources. 
      Pedicled flaps remain an important alternative to free flaps, and are less 
      resource intensive. This paper reviews our inaugural experience with the 
      submental island flap (SIF) and compares costs incurred to a matched cohort of 
      oral cancer patients reconstructed with forearm free flaps. METHODS: Charts of 
      patients who underwent SIF and RFFF reconstruction from January 1st 2013 to April 
      1st 2015 were retrospectively examined. Associated costs were obtained via online 
      database and previously reported costs at the study institution. RESULTS: Mean 
      length of ICU stay in glossectomy RFFF reconstruction was 4.7 days. Only one 
      patient required ICU stay for one night in the SIF group. Mean length of hospital 
      stay was not significantly different in SIF patients vs RFFF patients (12.4 vs 
      15.4 days, p > 0.05). Mean operative time was significantly lower in the SIF 
      group compared to the RFFF group (347 vs 552 min, p < 0.05). Total mean 
      intraoperative costs were found to be $4780.59 for RFFF operations, versus 
      $2307.94 for SIF. Total mean cost of post-operative stay was $18158.40 in the SIF 
      group and $43617.60 in the RFFF group. Total cost savings were therefore 
      $27931.85 per patient for the SIF group. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the 
      use of the submental island flap as an alternative to radial forearm free flaps, 
      showing both decreased hospital costs and comparable patient outcomes. Pedicled 
      flaps are making a resurgence in head and neck reconstruction, and the submental 
      island flap offers an excellent alternative to more labour intensive and costly 
      free flap alternatives.

AB  - The alterations in MHC class I expression play a crucial step in immune evasion 
      of cancer or virus-infected cells. This study aimed to examine whether tolerized 
      grafts modified MHC class I expression. FVB/N mice were rendered tolerant of 
      C57BL/6 alloantigens by in utero transplantation of C57BL/6 marrows. Postnatally, 
      engrafted donor skins and leukocytes were examined for their MHC expression by 
      quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Engrafted donor skins upregulated 
      their MHC class I related gene transcripts after short-term (1~2 weeks) or 
      long-term (>1 month) engraftment. This biological phenomenon was simultaneously 
      associated with upregulation of TAP1 gene transcripts, suggesting an important 
      role of TAP1 in the regulation of MHC class I pathway. The surface MHC class I 
      molecules of H-2K(b) in engrafted donor leukocytes consistently showed 
      overexpression. Conclusively, the induction of allograft tolerance involved 
      biological modifications of donor transplants. The overexpression of MHC class I 
      within engrafted transplants of tolerant mice might be used as the tolerance 
      biomarkers for identifying a state of graft tolerance.

AB  - The anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap plays an essential part in plastic and 
      reconstructive surgery. However, repair of the anterolateral donor site has not 
      been the focus of the clinicians.To assess the clinical value and feasibility of 
      using a modified anteromedial thigh (AMT) perforator flap for repairing the ALT 
      free flap donor site.In this retrospective study, 16 ALT flaps were transferred 
      to resurface large soft-tissue defects (ranged from 7 × 5 to 13 × 8 cm) in the 
      foot or hand from June 2012 to March 2013. The donor sites were repaired with an 
      advancement flap pedicled with an AMT perforator. Sensation within the 
      advancement flap, return-to-work (RTW) time, the aesthetic appearance of the 
      donor sites, and functional recovery were measured.All 15 flaps survived 
      completely without necrosis. One flap developed partial necrosis in the tip but 
      healed with dressing changes after 1 week. The medain follow-up period was 3.5 
      months (range, 3-6 months). The average median time was 9.5 weeks (range 8-13 
      weeks). There was no numbness of the advancement flap. Additionally, there was no 
      specific complication at both the recipient and donor sites. Thigh quadriceps 
      muscle strength and activities of the knee were normal. All patients were 
      satisfied with the aesthetic outcome postoperatively at the 3-month to 6-month 
      follow-up.The modified advancement flap pedicled with an AMT perforator is an 
      ideal option for repairing the anterolateral donor site.

AB  - This study tested whether an alloimmune response can occur in the marrow donor 
      when infused or injected with leukocytes from their mixed chimeric transplant 
      recipient. Two mixed chimeras were produced after conditioning with three Gray 
      total body irradiation, donor marrow infusion, and post-grafting 
      immunosuppression. The marrow donors were then repeatedly infused and injected 
      with leukocytes from their respective chimeric recipient. A donor lymphocyte 
      infusion (DLI) into their mixed chimeras had no effect, even after the 
      experiments were repeated. The presence of blood dendritic cells (DCs) of 
      recipient origin was confirmed in chimeric recipients, as well as the presence of 
      microchimerism in the marrow donors. Donor sensitization did occur following 
      placement of a recipient skin graft that was confirmed following DLI into 
      recipients that changed the mixed chimeras into full donor chimeras. These 
      observations suggest that mixed chimerism renders recipient peripheral blood DCs 
      incapable of inducing a donor T cell response.
